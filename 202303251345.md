# Nonfunctional Requirement (NFR)

NFR is a global [Constraint](202303250956.md) and [Property](202303250953.md) on
a [computer system](202303242148.md) such as development costs, operational
costs, #performance, reliability, storage [Requirements](202303251303.md), I/O
device capability, system representations etc. It might be hard to model as it
is usually stated informally (ambiguity and contradictory), but it can be more
critical to [Functional Requirement](202303251342.md) as disqualify in NFR might
render the system useless.

Examples of NFR are:
- Interface requirements (#uiux)
- Performance requirements (response time, throughput)
- #security
- Operating requirements (physical constraint, personnel availability and skill
  level, accessibility for maintenance, environmental conditions)
- Lifecycle requirements (maintainability, enhanciability, portability, expected
  market, [product lifespan](202303251356.md))
- Limits on development (development time limits, resource availability,
  methodological standards)
- Economic requirements (immediate and/or long-term costs)
- Process requirements (mandating of #programming-language or development
  method)
