# Euler Circuit

Euler Circuit is an #[202204112129](202204112129.md) where there is a [cycle](202204112045.md)
that visits every edge exactly once. It has two properties. First, every vertex
has a **even number** of edges. Second, the undirected graph is connected.

A graph could be determined as an Euler Circuit by using #[202205021959](202205021959.md). This
will result in a [linear runtime complexity](202201171844.md).
