# Autokey Cipher

Autokey Cipher is an improvement to #[Vigen√®re Cipher](202210302259.md) that not
only use keyword but also plaintext as the part of the key generation which is
as long as the plaintext. By knowing the keyword, we can recover the rest of the
message as the plaintext is also part of the key. This makes it rather resilent
to [Kasiski Method](202210302317.md)#, however due to its inclusion of plaintext
as part of the key, it is not entirely safe from [Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)#.
