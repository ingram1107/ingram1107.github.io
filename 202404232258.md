# Cyclic Code Scheduling

In cyclic code scheduling, it defines a unit called **frame** which an interval
partitioned from the time line. The length of a frame is what we called *frame
size*. Pre-emption is forbidden within a frame, and scheduling decisions can only
be done at the beginning of each frame. The fist instance of each periodic task
is released at the beginning of some frame.

Cyclic code scheduling also defines three constraints: *frame size*, *limited
storage*, and *not missing deadline*. The frame size should be big enough for a
[Process](202210062301.md) to complete its execution within a frame. To save
storage, the chosen frame size should divide the major size (which is the
multiple of every process's period), and it must at least divide the period of
at least one task in the system. Combining the first two constraints, and to
meet the last constraint, the following formula is formed:

$$
\begin{align}
    2f - GCD(p_i, f) &\le D_i, i = 1,2,\ldots,n\\
    p_i \mod f &= 0, \exists i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}\\
    f &\ge \text{max}\{e_i, i=1,2,\ldots,n\}
\end{align}
$$

**Note**: The notation of a process or task is expressed in $T_1 = (f, p)$ where
$f$ denotes the frame size, and $p$ the period.

This kind of scheduling mechanism is often implemented in automotive.
