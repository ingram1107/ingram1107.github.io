# Internet Service Provider (ISP)

ISP forms the backbone of the Internet as they provide services for accessing,
using and participating it. Though they have a great power on controlling what
content should their users access, it is easily by-passable by changing
[Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md) or using
[Virtual Private Network (VPN)](202207150909.md)#.

There is a hierarchy for ISP: Tier 1 (the highest), Tier 2 and Tier 3 (the
lowest). Tier 1 ISPs, such as AT&T, and NTT, provides free of charge traffic
exchange between Tier 1 networks. Tier 2 ISPs usually provide regional Internet
services to the users, for example Telekom Malaysia (TM). Tier 3 ISPs, for
instance, Unifi, Maxis, Celcom etc., provide local Internet services. Network
traffic that is destined for Tier 2 and/or Tier 3 doesn't need to travel to a
central point for distribution, therefore increase the
[scalability](202210012123.md)# of the Internet.
