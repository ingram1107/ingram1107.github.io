# The Eminent Collapse of Capitalism

Capitalism will inevitable faces its own downfall even if it has developed
#[its highest form](202203051018.md). Its own [expansion](202205021612.md)# or
development will bring three effects: the growing anarchy of capitalism (creates
further antagonism within the system), the socialisation of process of
production (which lay down the foundation for a [[202204202040|socialist
state]]#) and the increasing organisation and class consciousness of
[proletariat](202204212051.md)#.

There is little the ruling class in the capitalist society could do much to
prevent its own destruction. They could not even impose proper regulation on the
market to prevent crises and often fail to act upon crises ([The Great
Depression][1], [1997 Asian financial crisis][2] and [2007 financial
crisis][3]).
