# Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC)

PVC is, like the name suggested, a permanent connection within
#[packet-switched network](202207150848.md) that is set up and configured
manually. Since it is running at all times, there's no need to call setups or
termination. Therefore, compare to [Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC)](202208301240.md),
it has only 2 operational states: *Data Transfer* and *Idle*. Typically, it is
installed for direct connections between sites.
