# Control Structure Testing

Control structure testing is an approach of [White Box Testing](202305202159.md)
that includes **data flow testing** (selects test paths of a program according
to the locations of definitions and uses of variable in the program), **loop
testing**, and **condition testing** (logical conditions contained in a program
module).
