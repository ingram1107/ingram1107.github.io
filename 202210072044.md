# Output Feedback (OFB)

Output Feedback is a [stream mode of operation](202209281239.md)# of
#[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md) and #[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)
where the preceding encryption output of the [permuted](202210052159.md)
[encrypted](202209281136.md) initialisation value (feedback) is used as the
input to the encryption #algorithm. The feedback is indenpendent of message thus
can be computed in advance. Full blocks are used. It is pretty similar to
[Cipher Feedback (CFB)](202210071136.md) otherwise.

**Note**: Notice in stream mode, plaintexts are XORed instead of encrypted as
they are not the input to the cipher.

The encryption formula is shown below:

$$
\begin{align}
C_i &= p_i \oplus S(o_i)\\
O_i &= \text{ des}_{k1} (C_{i-1} \oplus P_{i-1})\\
O_{0} &= iv
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertexst
- $p$ is the plaintext
- $\text{des}$ is the [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
  algorithm
- $k$ is the subkey
- $O$ is the output of the ciphertext
- $iv$ is the [initialisation vector](202210071133.md)#
- $S$ is the shift algorithm used

Although the bit errors will not propagate throughout the encryption scheme, it
is more vulnerable to message stream [Modification](202209261922.md) compare to
[Cipher Feedback (CFB)](202210071136.md). It is considered to be a variation of
[One-Time Pad](202209281248.md)#, therefore the same sequence (subkey and
initialisation vector) should be thrown away once used. Furthermore, the sender
and receiver need to be remained in sync.

Research has concluded that only OFB-64 should ever be used.

It is used for stream-oriented transmission over noisy channel such as satellite
communication.
