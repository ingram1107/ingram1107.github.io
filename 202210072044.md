# Output Feedback (OFB)

Output Feedback is a [stream mode of operation](202209281239.md)# of
#[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md) and #[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)
where the preceding encryption output of the ciphertext is used as the input to
the encryption #algorithm. The feedback is indenpendent of message. Full blocks
are used. It is pretty similar to [Cipher Feedback (CFB)](202210071136.md)
otherwise.

The encryption formula is shown below:

$$
\begin{align}
C_i &= p_i \oplus o_i\\
O_i &= \text{ des}_{k1} (o_{i-1})\\
O_{-1} &= iv
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertexst
- $p$ is the plaintext
- $\text{des}$ is the [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
  algorithm
- $k$ is the subkey
- $O$ is the output of the ciphertext
- $iv$ is the [initialisation vector](202210071133.md)#

Although the bit errors will not propagate throughout the encryption scheme, it
is more vulnerable to message stream [Modification](202209261922.md) compare to
[Cipher Feedback (CFB)](202210071136.md). It is considered to be a variation of
[One-Time Pad](202209281248.md)#, therefore the same sequence (subkey and
initialisation vector) should be thrown away once used. Furthermore, the sender
and receiver need to be remained in synchronisation.

Research has concluded that *full block feedback*, i.e., cfb-64 or cfb-128,
should ever be used for OFB encryption.

It is used for stream-oriented transmission over noisy channel such as satellite
communication.
