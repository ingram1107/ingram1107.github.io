# RFC 5322

RFC 5322 is a legacy standard that defines the format for electronic mail. The
basic structure of the e-mail consists of headers and a body, separated by a
blank line as shown below:

```
Date: Tue, 01 Nov 2022 20:53:42 (MYT)
From: Little Clover <littleclover909@gmail.com>
To: Ned Freed <ned@innosoft.com>
Cc: James Bone <jamesbone@md6.com>
Subject: Example

This is the mail body.
```

However, it has several limitations. It doesn't recognised other character
encoding schemes other than ASCII, non-textual data such as image and audio, and
long lines (72 to 254 characters). Furthermore, it may reject the message if it
exceeds a certain size. Although there are many schemes that could be used to
transmit executable or binary files within RFC 5322's boundary, none of them is
the standard. Therefore, it was replaced by #[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)](202211012200.md)
as the standard for mail structure.
