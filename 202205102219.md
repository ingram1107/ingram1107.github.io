# Greetings in Dutch

Regardless of #[202205102222](202205102222.md), to greet in #[202205102217](202205102217.md), one can say
*Hallo* if first met, and *Doei* before leaving. The alternatives for *Hallo*
are *Hoi* (often) and *Hey*. *Doei* alternatives are *Doeg*, *Dag* (means day)
and *Tot ziens*.

To be more formal, say the greetings according to #[202205102222](202205102222.md) with the
prefix *Goeden*. For example, *Goedenavond*, meaning good evening. Use *Goeie*
prefix if you want the conversation to be less formal, that is for everyday
cases. *Goeiemorgen* means good morning, which is the same as saying
*Goedenmorgen*.

Weirdly enough, Dutch people wave goodbye by saying *Goedendag* or *Goeiedag* in
formal or everyday cases. Both of them mean good day if translated literally
which can be used to greet too.
