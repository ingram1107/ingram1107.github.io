# Greetings in Dutch

Regardless of #[the period of day](202205102222.md), to greet in
#[dutch](202205102217.md), one can say *Hallo* if first met, and *Doei* before
leaving. The alternatives for *Hallo* are *Hoi* (often) and *Hey*. *Doei*
alternatives are *Doeg*, *Dag* (means day) and *Tot ziens*.

To be more formal, say the greetings according to #[the priod of day](202205102222.md)
with the prefix *Goeden*. For example, *Goedenavond*, meaning good evening. Use
*Goeie* prefix if you want the conversation to be less formal, that is for
everyday cases. *Goeiemorgen* means good morning, which is the same as saying
*Goedemorgen*.

Weirdly enough, Dutch people wave goodbye by saying *Goedendag* or *Goeiedag* in
formal or everyday cases. Both of them mean good day if translated literally
which can be used to greet too.
