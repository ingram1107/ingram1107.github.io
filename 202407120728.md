# CPU Non-Temporal Write Operation

Modern processors provide non-temporal write operations to bypass
[caching](202403191017.md) for data that will not be reused soon in favour of
caching frequently used data. No cache line is read, and the new content is
directly written to memory. [Write-Combining](202403271107.md) technique is used
for the processor trying to fill entire cache lines in order to minimise the
cost (in terms of memory) if it succeeds. Furthermore, memory ordering rules for
non-temporal writes can be relaxed, that is, program will need to explicitly
insert memory barriers, so the bandwidth can be used as much as possible.

Compare to conventional memory store operations which read the full cache line
and immediately modify and consume cached data, non-temporal write operation
provides more performance optimisation opportunities especially when dealing
with large data structure like matrices.
