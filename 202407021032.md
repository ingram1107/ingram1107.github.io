# Memory Compaction

Memory compaction is one of the solution to solve [External Fragmentation](202407021030.md)
by compacting the memory area adjacent to the unused blocks. This works by
shifting 32 bytes lower in the memory for a range of memory block addresses and
then combining them into a single 64-byte block. If, however, future allocations
are larger than 64 bytes, new block will remain a fragment. Memory compaction
continues until all free blocks are combined into a single large chunk.

There are several limitations of memory compaction. It is not possible for
memory compaction when [Processes](202210062301.md) hold physical addresses to
the allocated memory blocks. The process is also time-consuming and costly since
a holistic copy on the memory content is involved. A delay is expected for the
tasks that own the ongoing compacted memory blocks to wait for content accessing
until the compaction finishes.

Memory compaction is rarely implemented in embedded systems.
