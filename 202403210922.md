# Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)

TLB is a [CPU Cache](202403191017.md) that stores the result of translation of
virtual address into physical address. In other words, it is responsible for
storing the mapping, at least the most frequently accessed one, of programs'
virtual address and their corresponding physical address. Misses in TLB level
can be very costly as it is tiny.
