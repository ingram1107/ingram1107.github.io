# Testing Principles

Follows the following testing principles could help us to build up good test
cases, that is [not redundant](202206171004.md), neither too simple nor
complicated (fixed by [decoupling the responsibility](202202041514.md)), and
should be the best of the breed (the largest type or better type to uncover
bugs), which is able to uncover as-yet discovered bugs:
- All test should be traceable to customer [Requirements](202303251303.md). In
  simple words, the test cases built should determine if the requirements are
  achieved, and these requirements can be mapped to the corresponding test
  cases.
- Tests should be planned long [before testing begins](202206201159.md).
- The [Pareto principle](202305211430.md) applies to #software testing.
- Testing should begin with [Unit Testing](202206201320.md) and progress toward
  [Integration Testing](202206201330.md).
- It is not possible to reach 100% test coverage.
- Testing should be conducted by an independent third party.

**Note**: It is generally to focus the testing efforts more on the unfamiliar
domain.
