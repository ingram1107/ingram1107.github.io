# Node Processing Delay

Node processing delay is the time taken for a [Network Device](202207051821.md)
to examine the packet's header and where to direct the packet (forwarding or
computing the next hop). Sometimes, the time needed to check for bit-level
errors in the packet may be considered into the calculation.
