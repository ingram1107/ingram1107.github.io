# Argument

An argument is composed a sequence of multiple [Mathematical Statement](202204281244.md)#.
The last sequence of it is the **conclusion** of the argument. All previous
statements are called **premises**, assumptions or hypotheses. For an argument
to be valid, both conclusion and premises must be valid in form and
#[logically sound](202205062044.md).

To test the validity of an argument, follow the procedure below:
1. Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument
2. Construct a [Trusth Table](202205061151.md)# showing all the truth values of
   them.
3. Verify that the truth values for conclusion for every **critical row** are
   all *true*.

Critical row means a row of truth table which all the premises are *true*. If
the conclusion is true in every critical row, then we can say that the argument
is *valid*. However, if it is false in one of the critical rows, then the
conclusion is false, which implies the argument is [invalid](202206172053.md)#.

There are various form of arguments that is valid which they are called the
**rules of inference**. They are shown as below:
- [Syllogism](202206101739.md)#
- [Generalisation](202206101958.md)#
- [Specialisation](202206102007.md)#
- [Elimination](202206102016.md)#
- [Transitivity](202206102258.md)#
- [Proof by Division into Cases](202206171946.md)#
- [Contradiction Rule](202206172158.md)#
- [Conjunction](202207212158.md)#
- [Universal Instantiation](202302151737.md)
