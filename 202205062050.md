# Argument

An argument is composed a sequence of multiple [202204281244](202204281244.md)#.
The last sequence of it is the **conclusion** of the argument. All previous
statements are called **premises**, assumptions or hypotheses. For an argument
to be valid, both conclusion and premises must be valid in form and
#[logically sound](202205062044.md).

To test the validity of an argument, follow the procedure below:
1. Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument
2. Construct a [202205061151](202205061151.md)# showing all the truth values of them.
3. Verify that the truth values for conclusion for every **critical row** are all *true*.

Critical row means a row of truth table which all the premises are *true*. If
the conclusion is true in every critical row, then we can say that the argument
is *valid*. However, if it is false in one of the critical rows, then the
conclusion is false, which implies the argument is [invalid](202206172053.md)#.

There are various form of arguments that is valid which they are called the **rules of inference**. They are shown as below:
