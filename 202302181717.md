# C++ Module

C++ module is a C++ introduced in the C++20 standard where we can import user
defined header files as module which simplify the library dependency management.
In the header file, we can export the module by declaring the `export` keyword
with the module name defined:

```cpp
export module A;
```

Then, we can import module A into module B with the `import` keyword just like
importing library:

```cpp
import A;
```

Module unit is a translation unit that contains module declaration. The named
module is a collection of module units with the same module name. Module
interface unit is a module unit where its declaration is start with the keyword
`export` whereas module implementation unit is the one that start without it.
Module partition is a module unit that contains the module-partition.

When using [CMake](202302181755.md) as the build system, we can include the
modules with the following codes:

```cmake
target_sources(target_name
    INTERFACE
        FILE_SET cxx_modules TYPE CXX_MODULES FILES
        ...)
```
