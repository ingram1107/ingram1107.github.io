# Foreground Processing

Foreground processing is a processing policy where the
[Processes](202210062301.md) are run in a [Round-Robin](202404232253.md),
[pre-emptive](202404141550.md), or combined fashion. This implies that the
processes must be interrupt driven or are [real-time](202403301908.md).
