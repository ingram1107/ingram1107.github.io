# Bugis People

Bugis is a group of people originated from the Sulawesi island, Indonesia. Because of internal conflicts on the island, some migrated via sea and later settled around Sumatra, Riau and the Malay peninsula (especially in Selangor, Klang, and Linggi, Negeri Sembilan) in the late 17th century. They were described a fearless warrior and a capable merchant.

During the 18th century, they became heavily involve in the Malay affairs especially after the regicide of the last line of Melaka dynasty in the Johor Sultanate, Sultan Mahmud Shah II. Recruited by Perak (by Sultan Muzaffar and Raja Iskandar, later Sultan Iskandar) and Kedah (by Sultan Muhammad Jiwa) regime, they were sent to aid in the internal dynastic dispute. Their importance emphasised after the failure of the suppression of their influence in Selangor and Linggi by Johor's Raja Muda.

In 1721, they installed the son of Sultan Abdul Jalil (first Bendahara line of the Johor royal dynasty, assassinated in Terengganu by Raja Kecil, or later known as Sultan Abdul Jalil Rahmat Shah, who was based on Siak and gained supports from [202206301138](202206301138.md)), Sultan Sulaiman as the ruler of Johor. Under the banner Yamtuan Muda, initially Daeng Marewa and later Daeng Cellak, they asserted great control over the Johor politics, only rivalled by the Terengganu ruler at the time, Sultan Mansur Shah I. Sultan Salehuddin (1766-82), previously known as Raja Lumu, son of the Daeng Cellak, declared independence from the ever-weakening Johor Sultanate with the support of local Malay chiefs and nobles (orang tua), and formed the Selangor Sultanate. However, such move broke the cohesion between Riau Bugis and Selangor Bugis.

After the failed siege of [202205102217](202205102217.md) Melaka in 1784 due to the death of the Yamtuan Muda, Raja Haji, [Duct East India Company](202203051018.md) (_Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie_, VOC) expelled all Bugis in Riau, resulted in the declination of the Bugis influence in the Johor Sultanate's court as no Bugis can ever again to be in the position of Yamtuan Muda (reverted in 1804). Selangor was briefly fell into the hand of Dutch, but soon reclaimed by Sultan Ibrahim (1782-1826) with his followers from Pahang. Although Bugis had reasserted their position in the Johor court in the affairs of royal succession (supporting Sultan Abdul Rahman) following the declining power projection of VOC, they failed to compete to the power of Temenggung Daeng Ibrahim (supporting Sultan Hussain in Riau), with the support of local Malay chiefs, in the future.

The declination of the Bugis influence becomes inevitable after the [202207201017](202207201017.md)#.
