# APT

APT provides simplified interface to [dpkg](202409131419.md) for [Debian-based distro](202409131438.md)
package management with dependency resolution and advance search, aided by the
CLI tools `apt-get`, `apt-cache`, and `apt-file` (which might not be installed
by default). These three commands can be managed through a single CLI `apt`.

`apt-get` provides commands such as `update` (update package index), `upgrade`,
`install`, `remove`, `purge`, and `clean`. To fix broken dependency, we can pass
the flag `-f` to `install`.

`apt-cache` provides commands like `search` (allow regular expression) and
`show` (package information). Installed `.deb` files are stored in a local cache
located in `/var/cache/apt/archives/`.

`apt-file` provides command like `update` (package cache), `list` (package
content), and `search` (find file owner). Note that `search` can also show files
that belong to uninstalled packages.

Remote sources to include packages into the package management system can be
defined in `/etc/apt/sources.list` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` with the syntax
`archive-type:url:distro:components`. Archive type can be `deb` (binary
packages) or `deb-src` (source packages). Components may differ among distro.
For example, Ubuntu defines four types of them: `main` (official,
[open-source](202110161031.md)), `restricted` (official, close-source),
`universe` (community, open-source), and `multiverse` (close-source). Debian, on
the other side, defines five component types: `main` (packages that comply
Debian Free Software Guidelines, DFSG, and don't rely on software outside
`main`), `contrib` (DFSG-compliant packages that depend on software outside
`main`), `non-free` (non-DFSG-compliant packages), `security`, and `backports`
(more resent `main` packages).

**Note**: For the newly added remote source to be activated, run the command
`apt update` or `apt-get update` to update the package index.
