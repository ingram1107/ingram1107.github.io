# Exposed Node Problem

Exposed node problem describes a phenomenon in [wireless environment](202303301607.md)
where node B concerns about possible interference, albeit a misconception, on
node A's transmission to other nodes during its transmission to node C (that is
not communicating with node A). Thus, node B decides to refrain from
transmitting the data to node C, results in efficiency loss.
