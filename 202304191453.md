# Database Logical Design Phase

During logical design phase, we shall map the [Conceptual Schema](202304191446.md),
ideally with no [redundant and/or incomplete information](202302171903.md), to
the [Data Model](202302101219.md) implementation. It is hard to change given the
fact that such changes may result in effect on queries and updates across the
application codebase.
