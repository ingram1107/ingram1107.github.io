# Normalisation

Normalisation is a technique used on [database design](202302101219.md) to
reduce redundancy, that is information repetition in multiple places
unnecessarily, and incompleteness, that is the inability or hard to represent
certain information or aspects, from the design. The importance of normalisation
is to avoid inconsistency across the [Database](202302101139.md) in order to
update redundant copies and make the database more adaptable to new information.
