# Normalisation

Normalisation is a technique used on [database design](202302101219.md) to
reduce redundancy, that is information repetition in multiple places
unnecessarily, and incompleteness, that is the inability or hard to represent
certain information or aspects, from the design. The importance of normalisation
is to avoid inconsistency across the [Database](202302101139.md) in order to
update redundant copies and make the database more adaptable to new information.

The **first normal form (1NF)** is achieved when the domains of
[Attributes](202304200943.md) in a [Relation](202204282024.md) are all atomic or
indivisible. The trick is to eliminate all composite and multivalued attributes.
The former could be broken down into smaller attributes, whereas the latter
could be represented by unique tuple for each entry. However, this may put
burden on application side of programming and increase runtime cost due to data
type conversion.
