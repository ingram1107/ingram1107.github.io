# Wireless Connectivity

[Wireless](202302161842.md) connectivity is defined as interconnects devices
without using wires, and instead uses air (often time electromagnetic airwaves)
as the transmission medium. It is susceptible to noise, interference, and
weather conditions. Though quite convenient, setting up such wireless
environment have several challenges including varying media (interference,
noise, space and time influenced quality, sharing with unwanted [IEEE
802.11](202303292155.md) and non-802 devices), no assumption of full
connectivity ([hidden node](202304061135.md), [exposed node](202304061138.md)),
multiple international regularity requirements, [Mobility](202303292141.md), and
security (no physical boundaries, overlapping [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md)).
