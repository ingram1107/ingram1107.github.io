# Wireless Connectivity

[Wireless](202302161842.md) connectivity is defined as interconnects devices
without using wires, and instead uses air (often time electromagnetic airwaves)
as the transmission shared medium. It is susceptible to noise, interference, and
weather conditions. Though quite convenient, setting up such wireless
environment have several challenges including varying media (interference,
noise, space and time influenced quality, sharing with unwanted 
[IEEE 802.11](202303292155.md) and non-802 devices), no assumption of full
connectivity ([hidden node](202304061135.md), [exposed node](202304061138.md)),
multiple international regularity requirements, [Mobility](202303292141.md), and
security (no physical boundaries, overlapping [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md)).

Comparing to wired counterpart, it has higher loss-rates due to interference,
limited available spectrum, higher delays and [Jitters](202304092135.md), lower
#security, and more susceptible to simple active attacking.

Depending on the coverage of the wireless network, we can categorise them into
the following:
- [Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)](202303292149.md)
- [Wireless LAN (WLAN)](202302161710.md)
- [Wireless WAN (WWAN)](202303292152.md)
- [Wireless MAN (WMAN)](202303292150.md)
