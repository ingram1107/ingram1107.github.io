# Phase of Communism

After the #[capitalist state](202204202040.md) has been overthrown, the community
will organise a [transitional institution](202204211120.md)# in order to develop a
socialist mode of economy. From that nature, communism will start to develop and
establish itself into the newly built society.

## First Phase

In the first phase of communism, the means of production is going to be
converted from [private property](202205211156.md)# to common property, which
means they should be own by the community. The other way around will be coded to
be vile and punishable in such society.

The equal distribution of social consumption fund will be established. The
social consumption fund is derived from the remained state funds deducted from
necessary community maintenance. It will be distributed according to the labour
performance, that is how much work does the individual has worked.

However, there will be still inequality in this phase of communism, as there are
differences between individuals in, for example, strength, marital status and
burden from the family. Because of these differences exists, different
individual could have owned variety of wealth which will resulted in wealth
inequality.

Turning the spotlight to #[the state](202204202040.md). The state itself has yet
been eliminated as there is a necessity on safeguarding the common ownership of
the means of production which secures the equality of labour and the
distribution of products accords to the labour performed.

## Higher Phase

As the community accustomed to the practice of division of labour, the members
of it will come to the realisation of the principle "from each according to his
ability, to each according to his need". In such community, there will be no
distinction of mental and physical labour, and working will become a virtue not
merely for a livelihood.

In this stage, we could that the society has entered a higher phase of
communism.
