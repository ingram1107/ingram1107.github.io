# Total Nodal Delay

Total nodal delay is equal to the sum of [node processing delay](202302161902.md),
[queuing delay](202302161904.md), [transmission delay](202302161914.md), and
[propagation delay](202302161917.md). It is shown as the following equation:

$$
d_{\text{nodal}} = d_{\text{proc}} + d_{\text{queue}} + d_{\text{trans}} +
d_{\text{prop}}
$$

Assuming the queuing delay is negligible and the number of [Network Devices](202207051821.md)
sit between the source and destination is $N - 1$, we can calculate the total
end-to-end delay by using the following formulae:

$$
d_{\text{e2e}} = N(d_{\text{proc}} + d_{\text{trans}} + d_{\text{prop}})
$$
