# Git Revert Commits

We can reverse changes in a Git repository using two commands: `reset` and
`revert`. These commands could be used alongside with
[symbols](202205251604.md)# like `^` and `~`.

`reset {commit}` is used on local Git repositories. It moves the
[current branch starting position](202204261226.md) to the specified commit and
discards all changes after that commit. This results in a new commit history.
All discarded commits could be still found in Git Reflog.

`revert {commit}` is used on remote Git repositories. Instead of moving the
branch starting position, it creates a commit that revert all the changes done
by the commit and after it. No history will be changed other than having a new
commit.
