# Diameter

Diameter is a new #[Triple A (AAA)](202210221150.md) protocol standardised by
RFC3588 and RFC4005. It is derived from and aim to replace
[Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md) (also provides
the transition support) with enhancements such as error handling and message
delivery reliability. Instead of relying on a central AAA server, it employs a
peer-to-peer architecture, which means that every host or node that implements
Diameter could act as either a server or client, with additional support of peer
discovery via static configuration or dynamic lookup. The protocols in used by
Diameter are connection-oriented protocols such as #[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) with a maximum attribute data
size of 16,777,215 octets (8 bit). It supports both [Link Encryption](202210062110.md)#
and [End-to-end Encryption (e2e)](202210062112.md)#.

A Diameter agent could have agent support of *Relay*, *Proxy*, *Redirect*, or
*Translation*. The server can initiate messages in time of, for example,
re-authentication or session termination, and is capable of handling protocol
and application errors. The client can negotiate supported applications and
security level with the server using Diameter.

Comparing to [Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md), it
supports transport layer security such as [IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS). Furthermore, it has larger address space for
Attribute Value Pairs (AVP) and identifiers (32-bit instead of 8-bit). Moreover,
it supports application layer acknowledgements and has error notification, basic
support for user-sessions and accounting, and better roaming support than
RADIUS. It is also more easily extended. It also supports both stateful and
stateless models.
