# Ab Initio Folding

*Ab initio* folding does [Protein Structure Prediction](202310291139.md) from
the beginning of the sequence, thus is the most difficult method. It assumes
that all information of the protein structure is contained in its
[Amino Acid](202308082207.md) sequence, and a globular protein folds into the
structure with the lowest free energy. It requires a scoring function and a
search strategy. The generated resolution is generally low, but still useful as
structural models.

The folding builds structures from the sequence based on the first-principle,
including the use of energy function (bond, bond angle, dihedral, van der Waals,
electrostatic) to describe the protein. The structure can be calculated through
minimising the energy function to find the most stable structure. It is
practical in general as it has **poor accuracy** and **expensive computational
costs**. The error rate will rise rapidly after the identity is lower than 30%.

Examples of *ab initio* folding:
- Rosetta method (have accuracy of 3 to 6 Ã… root mean square deviation (RMSD)
