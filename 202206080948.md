# Terraform Project Structure

If the #[HashiCorp Terraform](202205041220.md) Project grows larger, there is a
need to have a more organised directory structure. The conventional project
structure is as follows:

```
tf_project/
  main.tf
  variables.tf
  output.tf
  provider.tf
```

The file `main.tf` usually contain the main configuration for the infrastructure
which could contain definitions of resource. `variables.tf` is a file that
stores defined [Terraform Variable](202206151015.md)# for the project.
`output.tf` will contain outputs from the resources. Last but not least,
`provider.tf` keep provider definitions.
