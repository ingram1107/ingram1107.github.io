# National Self-Determination

National Self-Determination which means one #[202203011147](202203011147.md) should be able to
determine their own destine or fortune without the
#[intervention](202203051018.md) from the other powers.

It is the core idea of *left-wing patriotism*. For the oppressed nation,
patriotism is necessary to bring the total national liberation from the
oppressing nation which in itself is anti-imperialism. For the oppressing
nation, *defeatism* is necessary to bring down the state apparatus used by the
ruling class to end its oppression in oppressed nations.

If the nation is incorporated into another nation without the clear and
voluntarily expressed consent and be decided by a free vote, which is taken
after the withdrawal of the aggressive army and without any degree of pressure,
such incorporation is annexation, i.e., the seizure and violence on the people,
which is vile and vicious.
