# Prism's Algorithm

Prism's Algorithm is a #[202204151143](202204151143.md) which is used to solve
#[202204272006](202204272006.md). It is pretty much the same to [202204151059](202204151059.md)#. The update
rule for the algorithm could be simplified to $d_w = \text{min}(d_w, c_{w,v})$
after vertex $v$ is selected for each unknown $w$ adjacent vertices. $d$ denoted
the weight of the edge.
