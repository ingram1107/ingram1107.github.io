# Amazon RDS

RDS provides managed [relational database](202302101331.md) service to the
customer. Customer only has to manage application optimisation, as operating
system and database software installation and patching, automatic backups, high
[Availability](202210022157.md) (multi-[AZ](202312011406.md) deployment) etc.
are the responsibility of Amazon.

**Note**: We can access to the RDS by referring to its generated
[Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md) endpoint.

RDS supports the creation of read replica for [SQL](202302231241.md) databases
which is suited for read-heavy workloads. The update to the primary database is
copied asynchronously to the replica.

There are 6 database engines for us to choose from:
- MySQL
- Amazon Aurora (compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- Microsoft SQL Server
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB ([NoSQL](202302192224.md))
- Oracle

Amazon suggests using RDS if there are complex transactions or queries to be
made, medium to high query or write rate (15,000 reads or writes), no more than
a single worker, or looking for high durability. However, it is discouraged if
the database requires massive read/write rates, sharding (high data size or
[Throughput](202304111957.md) demand), simple HTTP requests, or
[RDBMS](202302101137.md) customisation.
