# Network Management System (NMS)

NMS is a set of #hardware and/or #software tools that allows administration of
individual components of a network within a larger [Network Management](202212211445.md)#
framework. It consists of [Management Station or Manager](202212211516.md)#,
[Management Agent](202212211524.md)#, [Management Information Base (MIB)](202212211528.md)#,
and [Network Management Protocol](202212211531.md)#. These components assist in
*[Network Device](202207051821.md)# discovery*, *network device monitoring*,
*network performance analysis*, and *intelligent notifications*.

**Note**: Network device discovery could be utilised to detect unauthorised
access point.
