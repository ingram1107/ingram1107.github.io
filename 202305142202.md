# Proactive Risk Management

Proactive [Risk Management](202305142158.md) identifies the risks and assess
their probability and impact, then ranks them in priority. A plan is established
to manage the risk with the primary goal to avoid risk, but contingency plans
should be developed when encountering unforeseen failure in order to have a
control and effective response to it.
