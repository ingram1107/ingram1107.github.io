# Proactive Risk Management

Proactive [Risk Management](202305142158.md) identifies the risks and assess
their probability and impact, then ranks them in priority. A plan is established
to manage the risk with the primary goal to avoid risk, but contingency plans
should be developed when encountering unforeseen failure in order to have a
control and effective response to it.

The following 3 steps could help in managing the risk in a project:
1. Develop a risk management plan, reviews any internal or external factors
   (project's scope, stakeholders, budget, schedule etc.) which may affect the
   project, and defines roles and responsibilities, risk management methods and
   procedures, categories of risks, and contingency plans.
2. Identify the risks and their probability. We could include a means of
   identification and a brief description of the risk on what might be the cause
   of it, who is responsible to handle it, and its potential impact on the
   project.
3. Analyse the risks with qualitative risk analysis (estimate the probability
   and degree of impact) and quantitative risk analysis (interpret the impact in
   terms of dollars, time, scope, or quality).
