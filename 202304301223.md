# Star Integration

Star integration, aka spaghetti integration, is a [System Integration (SI)](202303242149.md)
where each subsystem is interconnected with each other in a point-to-point
manner, which might look similar to a [Mesh Network](202304211344.md). Although
its extreme flexibility and capability to reuse of functionality in an ad hoc
manner, doesn't think about the future is preferred by organisations, the system
cost abided to this type of integration could vary according to the interfaces
which subsystems are exporting. In the case of exporting heterogeneous or
proprietary interfaces or extending the additional subsystems, the integration
time and cost could be substantial. Most data analytics companies favour this
method of system integration in order to have wider perspective to analyse user
behaviours and preferences.
