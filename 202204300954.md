# Ansible Content Navigator

`ansible-navigator` is a #[202204292323](202204292323.md) command line interface (CLI) tool to
view or monitor various #[202204272021](202204272021.md) information. It can run
[202204272036](202204272036.md)# and [202204300942](202204300942.md)#. It is an enhanced version of
`ansible-playbook` which unlike the latter, can run EE.

If running without any command or options, `ansible-navigator` will open up a
terminal user interface (TUI) to monitor various information on all hosts.

Executing the command `run {playbook}` will run the [202204272036](202204272036.md)# on the
managed nodes. With `--check` option, Ansible navigator will dry run the
specified playbook which means that the configuration will not impose on the
managed nodes.

We can run `inventory` command to show the [202204272043](202204272043.md)# information from
all hosts. To list the information from only a specified host or group, pass it
in as an argument to the command as in `inventory {host/group}`. For more
verbosity, use the option `--list`. If verbosity is not desired, use the option
`--graph` instead.

The global configuration stores in `$HOME/.ansible-navigator.yml`. We can access
the logs in `$HOME/.ansible-navigator/logs/`.
