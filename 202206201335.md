# Regression Testing

Regression Testing is a kind of testing that compares the output of the current
tests (usually #[Unit Testing](202206201320.md), #[Integration Testing](202206201330.md)
and #[Performance Testing](202206201415.md)) with the previous values (from
previous ran tests). It is used to find out the disparity or difference, if
there is any, of performance, contract, validity etc. between new, modified, or
fixed #software.
