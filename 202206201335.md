# Regression Testing

Regression Testing is a kind of testing that compares the output of the current tests (usually #[202206201320](202206201320.md), #[202206201330](202206201330.md) and #[202206201415](202206201415.md)) with the previous values (from previous ran tests). It is used to find out the disparity or difference, if there is any, of performance, contract, validity etc. between them.
