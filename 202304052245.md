# Tuple Relational Calculus

Tuple relational calculus is a [non-procedural query language](202303221404.md).
It is pretty similar to [set theory](202204281446.md) which mostly using the
[Set-Builder Notation](202204281700.md) with the addition of $t[A]$ denotes the
value of tuple $t$ on attribute $A$. There is a possibility that tuple
relational calculus expression might result in an unsafe result, that is
generating infinite tuples. This is solved by using domain with the notation
$dom(P)$ where $P$ is a formula that consists of any set atoms (variables or
operations).
