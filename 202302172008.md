# Strategy Pattern

Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each of them, and
make them interchangeable. It involves three participants: **strategy**
(interface common to all concrete strategy), **concrete strategy** (actual
algorithm implementation), and **context** (have a reference to a strategy
object).

The Gang of Four advised to use such pattern when:
1. There are related classes differ only in their behaviours.
2. There are different variants of an algorithm (like [Sorting](202302172013.md)).
3. The data used by an algorithm needed to be encapsulated from client.
4. There are many behaviours defined in a class via multiple conditional
   statements (useful in [Refactoring](202206032059.md)).

Strategy pattern can particularly useful in implementing different controller
for single view in [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](202207041054.md).
