# Salafism

Salafism is a Sunni reform movement that born in the period when the Mongols
invaded the Mesopotamia and later gained traction when #[western imperialism](202203051018.md) dominated in Arab World and Indian subcontinent.

Ibn Taymiyya is the main inspiration behind the movement. He objected the
innovations of the Islam theology at the time particularly Sufi innovation such
as Sufi whirling. Ibn Taymiyya didn't fond on the idea that visiting the grave
of saints or prophets and their family with the intension of getting blessed
either. He rejected the traditional Sunni schools (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and
Hanbali) on their method of the Islamic law (sharia) interpretation. Instead of
relying on reasoning and/or past jurist's judgement, Ibn Taymiyya advocated
return to the original text of Quran. When interpreting Quran texts, those texts
should be understood literally instead of treating them as metaphors. For
example, the Quran said that the God (Allah) has hands, Ibn Taymiyya argued that
God does have hand, just that it is not in the way which human can imagine.

Furthermore, Ibn Taymiyya encouraged the idea that Muslim that doesn't follow
the orthodox Islamic practices should be treated as non-believer. This is
believed to be influenced by his hatred on the Mongols which devastated his home
of origin, Iraq.

Some Islamic scholars heavily criticised his view, and during his lifetime,
Salafism was not popular.
