# Diffraction

Diffraction is a bending of waves as they pass through an opening or around a
barrier, that is relatively larger to the wavelength, in their path and flare
out the obstacle's geometric shadow. In #networking, we may receive the signal
even if there is no line of sight (LOS) to the transmitter.
