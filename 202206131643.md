# Protocol Data Units (PDU)

PDU is the basic data communication unit for layers in
#[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md). It includes
important data such as control information (in the form of headers and trailers)
and user data. Each layer may name it differently. If the PDU is pass down (from
higher layer to lower layer), the process is called
[Encapsulation](202210012046.md)# as more control information are added to it.
Otherwise, it is [Decapsulation](202210012048.md)#, where control information
are strip over as it is passed up the stack.
