# Euclidean Algorithm

Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the #[Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](202210092214.md)
between the number $a$ and $b$, typically denoted as $EUCLID(a, n)$. It uses the
[modulo nature](202210090858.md)# of two numbers, where $a = qn + b$, $b$ as the
remainder of $a \mod n$, following the steps:
1. Apply the formula $a = qn + b$,
2. If $b = 0$, then $n = GCD(a, n)$,
3. Replace the value of $a$ with $n$ and the value of $n$ with $b$ in the
   equation,
4. Repeat step 1.
