# The Reign of Caliph Ali bin Abi Talib

Ali bin Abi Talib is the forth and the last [Rashidun Caliphs](202302181011.md).
He was elected as caliph with the support of the Medina local and the rebels
that killed [Caliph Uthman](202302241122.md). Due to the pressure of the rebels,
he refused the demands from Aisyah, the widow of the prophet, and
[Muawiyah bin Abu Sufyan](202302241557.md), the governor of Syria appointed by
[Caliph Umar](202302190619.md) and the cousin of Caliph Uthman, to severely
punished the rebels. Due to this disagreement and Ali's agenda of
anti-corruption (aiming at removing Muawiyah as Syrian governor), the First
Fitna (first Muslim civil war) broke out. After defeating Aisyah at the Battle
of Camel, he moved the capital from Medina to Kufah, Iraq. Ali later confronted
Muawiyah, and agreed to arbitration despite in the winning of the Battle of
Siffin, in which ended in disaster as Ali was denounced during the arbitration
and Muawiyah was recognised as the Caliph. In 661, he was killed by Abdul Rahman
bin Muljam, an assassin from extreme branch of Islam, Khawarijites, who
disagreed the arbitration and denounced both parties.
