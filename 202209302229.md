Protocol is rules that govern communications. It usually needs to have *an
identified sender and receiver*, *common language and grammar or syntax*, *speed
and timing of delivery*, and *confirmation or acknowledgement requirements*. A
typical computer protocol includes *message encoding*, *message formatting and
[encapsulation](202210012046.md)#*, *message size*, [Message Timing](202209302241.md)#,
and [message delivery options](202209302253.md)#.
