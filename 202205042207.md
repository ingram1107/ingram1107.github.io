# Ansible Roles

Role is a disaggregated #[202204272036](202204272036.md) which is reusable and
#[distributable](202204300837.md) (could be seen as a collection). It has a
directory structure which includes
[default variables, handlers and others](202205042134.md)#, metadata (dependencies
which could be fetched by [202205051149](202205051149.md)#), tasks, [202205051607](202205051607.md)#, and
tests, shown as below:

```
roles/
  defaults/
    main.yml
  handlers/
    main.yml
  meta/
    main.yaml
  README.md
  tasks/
    main.yml
  templates/
  tests/
    inventory/
    test.yml
  vars/
    main.yml
```

By default, `roles` module defined in #[202204272036](202204272036.md) will look into local
directory to find roles. If namespace is given to a role, it will in turn find
it in content sharing platform.

There are two directories that store defined [202205042134](202205042134.md)# : `defaults` and
`vars`. While `defaults` set the default value for a variable, `vars` takes
higher precedence if there is a duplication since variables defined in here are
more specific.
