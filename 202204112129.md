# Undirected Graph

Undirected #[202204112045](202204112045.md) treats edges as non-directional. This means that
the edge $(u, v)$ and the edge $(v, u)$ are the same edge. It also indicates
that an undirected graph **cannot** have *loop* and *cycle*. It is useful to
represent a sparse graph.

An undirected graph is *connected* if there is a path from every vertex to every
other vertex. If a removal of a node will not undermine its connectivity, then
the graph is [biconnected](202205022012.md)#.
