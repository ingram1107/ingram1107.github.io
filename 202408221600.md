# Common IT Security Threats

There are several IT security threats that a system analyst should be considered
when coming out with an [Information Assurance](202408141942.md) policy.
Examples of them are *errors and negligence* (includes programming errors),
*fraudulent and theft activities*, *loss of infrastructure*,
*[Malware](202301031611.md)*, *attackers*, *employee sabotage*, *industrial
espionage* (via bribery, blackmail, technological surveillance), *invasion of
privacy*, *social engineering*, *spamming* etc.

A disgruntled employee may try to damage key infrastructure of the organisation,
reveal [Confidential](202210022150.md) information to competitors, spread hoaxes
or anonymous rumours, threaten the health and safety of others, or steal
important documents.
