# Mach's Networking

#[202203021657](202203021657.md) concentrates its efforts on utilising its communication
facilities, which is message-passing. This resulted in a blending of memory and
[202204222158](202204222158.md)# where Mach could be used for distributed and parallel
programming.

To improve the efficiency, Mach caches the remote memory objects into local
memory. For local memory objects, it passes the [messages](202204231432.md) by
merely moving the pointer to point to the shared memory objects. For all
messages, if they are local to the machine, especially if they are large too,
they are [202203251058](202203251058.md). Otherwise, they will be handled by [202204231514](202204231514.md)#.
