# Enterprise Integration

Enterprise integration is a task of making diverse applications [work together](202303242149.md)
to produce a unified set of functionality. The following shows the main decision
criteria on choosing and designing an integration approach:
- Application coupling: minimises dependencies between applications.
- Intrusiveness: minimises the changes to the application and the amount of
  integration code needed.
- Technology selection: to suit the integration technique chosen.
- Data format
- Data timeliness: minimises the time of data synchronisation between different
  applications.
- Data or functionality: abstraction between applications due to data and
  functionality sharing.
- Remote connection: [Asynchronous](202304281232.md) [Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)](202302161128.md).
- Reliability: RPC versus local call

There are different styles of enterprise integration:
- [Enterprise Integration File Transfer](202305011115.md)
- [Enterprise Integration Shared Database](202305011119.md)
- [Enterprise Integration Remote Procedure Invocation](202305011123.md)
- [Enterprise Integration Messaging](202305011126.md)
