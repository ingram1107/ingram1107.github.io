# Interface Metaphor

Interface metaphor conveys a product's purpose and its use on an activity by
dressing itself similar to a physical entity but with additional properties. It
can exploit the user's familiarity of the metaphor to understand the unfamiliar
aspect of the product functionality. It makes learning the system easier,
helping users to understand the underlying [Conceptual Model](202304152151.md).
[Interface designer](202303242108.md) can be innovative and enable the realm of
the computers and their applications to be made more accessible to a greater
crowd. That being said, there is a risk of breaking conventional and cultural
rules while using interface metaphor. It might be too constraining when trying
to conceptualise the problem space to add new functionality for a computational
task. Furthermore, it may conflict with [Design Principles](202304081725.md).
There is a problem of interface metaphor that restrict the user from utilising
the full power of the product beyond the implication from the metaphor. The
designers may overly translate existing bad design literally and fixate on
well-known technologies and past design without exploring their own
creativeness.
