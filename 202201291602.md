# Semaphore in Pthread

Semaphore is another way to lock a critical section other than
[mutex](202112061117.md) which could prevent the
#[202112061109](202112061109.md). It could be used to restrict the number of
possible **simultaneous accesses** to limited amount of resources. The
difference between semaphore and mutex is the thread that lock the mutex **own
the mutex** for its entire lifetime. Semaphore does not introduce ownership to
the threads that lock or decrement it.

Unlike [mutex](202112061117.md), the library for semaphore is not couple into
`<pthread.h>`. Instead, we should import it from `<semaphore.h>`.

The syntax to create, initialise and destroy semaphore is similar to
[mutex](202112061117.md). The keywords are `sem_t`, `sem_init`, and `sem_destroy`.
There are two semaphore operations: `sem_wait` and `sem_post`. `sem_wait` is
used to check if the semaphore is greater than 0. It will proceed if so, wait in
there if not until the value of semaphore is greater than 0. `sem_post` need to
be called after the critical section in order to release the occupied semaphore
by incrementing its value. Note their similarity to the `pthread_mutex_lock` and
`pthread_mutex_unlock`.

```c
sem_t semaphore;

// in the program
sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 4); // This semaphore could be lock by a maximum of 4
                            // threads

// at somewhere
sem_wait(&semaphore); // decrement to 3
sem_post(&semaphore); // increment back to 4

// at the end of the program
sem_destroy(&semaphore);
```

## Inspect the Semaphore's Value

To inspect the current value of the semaphore, we could call `sem_getvalue` on
it. However, be reminded that the reading of the semaphore's value is not
[202112061109](202112061109.md) free in the sense that there is no default safeguard around it.
Do not rely on this function to consistently retrieve the value from the
semaphore.

```c
int val;

sem_getvalue(&sem, &val);
```
