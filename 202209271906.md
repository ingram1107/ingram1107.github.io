# Immutable Infrastructure

Immutable Infrastructure aka immutable operating system or immutable deployment
is a server deployment paradigm where the server is read-only, meaning the
services, including [file system](202202060057.md), *are replaced* instead of
being updated in place. The soon-to-be replaced service doesn't get changed, the
new service instance with the appropriate changes will be created, and the old
service instance will simply be destroyed (with the help from [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](202206061419.md)#
tools). Most immutable infrastructure utilises [Container](202202211633.md)
technology to create an image-only deployment. It eases the work of versioning
(updating services), rollback, recovery, scaling, and #security maintenance.

Examples of immutable infrastructure are:
- CoreOS (merged with [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](202205251159.md))
- Project Atomic
- Ubuntu Core
- RancherOS
- Talos
- K3OS (discontinued)
- Flatcar
- [Fedora](202210012320.md) Silverblue
- Photon OS
