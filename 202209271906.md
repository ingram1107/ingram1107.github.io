# Immutable Infrastructure

Immutable Infrastructure is a server deployment paradigm where services *are
replaced* instead of being updated in place. The soon-to-be replaced service
doesn't get changed, the new service with the appropriate changes will be
created, and the old service will simply be destroyed (with the help from
[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](202206061419.md)# tools). It eases the work of
versioning (updating services), rollback, recovery, and scaling.
