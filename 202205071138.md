# Dialogic Learning

Dialogic Learning is a method of learning that emphasises on egalitarian
dialogues. Teachers and learners focuses on **validity** of a claim rather than
the **power** come from the hierarchy. This enables learners to be the active
participants in the learning process instead of as passive recipients that do
not question the legitimacy from the knowledge that they perceived.

Questions asked during the learning process does not aim for a fixed answer. It
is open-ended in the sense that everyone can give the responses based on their
opinions. Additionally, the answer produced are treated to lead towards more
questions. The answer should not be the end goal of a question. This encourages
diverse views to be expressed in the classroom.

Talking in the classroom does not mean to give information from the top-down. It
should be a trigger for more discussions to come. Instead of being
authoritative, teacher should give learners to start the conversation where
he/she lead it or refine the arguments that come from the discussion.
