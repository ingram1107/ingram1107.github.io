# Ansible Playbooks

Playbooks are YAML files that are used for #[202204272021](202204272021.md) configuration.
Structurally, it contains plays, [202205042134](202205042134.md)#, [202204300820](202204300820.md)#, and
[202204300825](202204300825.md)#. They could be run by the command line `ansible-playbook` or
#[202204300954](202204300954.md). It is shown as below:

```yaml
--- # start of a play
- name: install and start apache
  hosts: web  # individual host or group
  become: yes # This is a plugin that escalate privilege (root permission)

  vars: # define variables for a play, not recommended
    var1: Ansible
    var2: This is
    var3: "{{ var2 }} {{ var1 }}" # Result: This is Ansible

  tasks:  # From here, define tasks
    - name: httpd package is present
      yum: # This is a module
        name: httpd
        state: latest
      debug:  # Debugging messages
        msg: "some debugging messages"

    - name: latest index.html is present
      template: # This is a module
        src: files/index.html
        dest: /var/www/html/

    - name: httpd is started
      service: # This is a module
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

**Note**: The order of the tasks written in the playbook is their order of
execution.

**Note**: In the play section, we could add `role` to import [202205042207](202205042207.md)#.
If we just need that role for a task, we could include it using `include_role`
under `tasks`.
