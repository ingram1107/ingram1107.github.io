# Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

IPS is similar to [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](202303081739.md) as it
[detects intrusion attempts](202301031034.md) with a known database of attack
signatures. However, unlike IDS, it halts intrusion attempts in real time due to
the aid of additional functionalities.

IPS employs **active monitoring**, that is the network traffic has to pass
through the IPS sensor for analysis. If an intrusion signature matched, the
traffic will be dropped immediately and an alarm is sent to the management
console.
