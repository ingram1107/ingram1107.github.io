# Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

RSA is an #[Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md) scheme based on
exponentiation in a [Galois Field](202210100956.md) over integers
[modulo](202210090858.md) a prime which utilises integers as large as 1024 bits.
The [running time](202201171853.md) for exponentiation is $o((\log n^3))$
operations, which is reasonable. However, to break the #algorithm, it needs
$o(e^{\log n \log \log n})$ factorisations, thus it is [hard to crack](202209281245.md)#.

The security of RSA is guarantee by its [Trapdoor One-Way Function](202211072039.md)#
nature as primes $p$ and $q$ are only known to the key owner. It is impossible
to do a [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md) on RSA due to the large key size.
Other [Cryptanalytic Attack](202209281257.md) such as mathematical attack based
on difficulty of computing $\phi(n)$, by factoring modulus $n$ (can be overcome
by having a larger $n$), [timing attacks](202210122125.md)# on *decryption
algorithm*, and chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA) can be done on RSA.

**Note**: Current $n$ is of $2^{1024}$ to $2^{2048}$ bit size. It is currently
assumed to be [computational secure](202209281245.md)#.

The public and private key generation in RSA follows the below steps:
1. Randomly select two large primes $p$ and $q$.
2. Compute $n = p \cdot q$ where $n$ will be used use as the modulus for public
   and private key.
3. Compute $\phi (n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)$. ([Euler Totient Function](202210222004.md)#)
4. Select $e$ such that $1 < e < \phi (n)$ and $GCD(e, \phi (n)) = 1$ according
   to [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](202210092214.md)#.
5. Find the decryption key $d$ from $de = 1 \mod \phi (n)$ and $0 \le d \le n$.

**Note**: $p$ and $q$ must be kept secret as the attacker could easily compute
$n$ if known. They must be rather large to avoid easy guessing.

**Note**: $e$ is usually relatively small or $65537_{10}$ which is
$10000000000000001_2$ for easy computation by [Square-and-Multiply Algorithm](202211141413.md)#.
That being said, $e$ can't be either 1 or 2. The former means no encryption is
done on $M$ as $M^e = M^1 = M$. The latter will not work due ($d$ not exist) to
the nature of [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](202210092214.md)# since $GCD(2,
\phi(n))$ will always be 2 as $\phi(n) = (p - 1) (q - 1)$ where $p$ and $q$ are
primes results in even number. However, if $e$ is too small, it is vulnerable to
mathematical attack using [Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)](202210222043.md)#.

From here, we could get the public key $pu = \{e, n\}$ and private key $pr =
\{d, n\}$. Encryption could be done on message $M$ using the formula $C = M^e
\mod n$ where $0 \le M < n$ by using public key $pu$ which is typically done by
[Square-and-Multiply Algorithm](202211141413.md)# for efficiency. Decryption
could be done on ciphertext $C$ using the formula $M = C^d \mod n$ by using
private key $pr$ which is usually done by [Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)](202210222043.md)#.

RSA works in both encryption and decryption due to the nature of the equation
$de = 1 \mod \phi(n)$ which can be reformed into the equation $de = 1 + k
\phi(n)$ ([Modular Arithmetic](202210090858.md)#) and the fact that $M^{\phi(n)}
\mod n = 1$ ([Euler's Theorem](202210222028.md)#). From decryption equation $C^d
= M^{e \cdot d} = M^{1 + k \cdot \phi(n)} = M^1 \cdot (M^{\phi(n)})^k = M^1
\cdot 1^k = M^1 = M \mod n$, thus proved that RSA works.

However, using the above algorithm, primarily the decryption part, is exposed to
possible [Timing Attack](202210122125.md)# and [CCA](202212092253.md)#. Several ways of
[Avoiding Timing Attack on RSA](202212092248.md)# could be done to the algorithm
in order to avoid or decrease the efficiency from timing.
