# RNA Folding

RNA chains fold back on themselves to form local regions of double helix, that
is [secondary structure](202310311055.md) just like what is done in
[protein](202308082207.md). Stem loop or hairpin is created when there are two
complementary sequences within a single strand come together to form
double-helical structure. Diverse noncanonical pairings fold RNA secondary
structure into tertiary structure. RNA has a tendency to fold into and become
kinetically trapped in alternative conformations and difficulty in specifying a
single tertiary structure that is thermodynamically strongly favour over
competing structures.

**Note**: Magnesium ion (Mg$^{2+}$) often used as aid in the stabilisation of
the complex RNA secondary structures.

RNA chaperone involves in destabilising the misfolded structure, and gives it
the chance to refold to the native structure.
