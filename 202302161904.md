# Queuing Delay

Queuing delay could be happened when multiple packets are needed to be sent over
a link and is queuing on the outbound link. The more packets are in queue, the
more delay it is. Assuming that the queue can hold infinite amount of packets,
the queuing delay can theoretically be infinite which is not ideal. We can
measure the *traffic intensity* using the following formula:

$$
\text{traffic intensity } = \frac{La}{R}
$$

Where:
- $L$ is the packet length
- $a$ is the average rate at which packets arrive at the queue
- $R$ is the transmission rate

Ideally, the traffic intensity should be less than or equal to one. In reality,
it is not possible for a queue to hold such large amounts of packet. If the
queue is full, the packet is instead being dropped by the [Network Device](202207051821.md).
Therefore, instead of measuring the average queuing delay, we measure the
network performance by measuring the packet loss. Depending on the selection
#algorithm, some packets may have higher [priority](202209282057.md) over the
others.
