# Ultra-Wideband (UWB)

UWB is a high rate, short-range [Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)](202303292149.md)
technology based on [IEEE 802.15.3a](202304271819.md) addressing emerging
applications in consumer electronics, personal computing, and mobile device
markets. The data rate supported is at least 480 Mbps, and it covers up to 20
metre.

UWB can be categorised into [single carrier](202305180837.md) and [multicarrier](202305180840.md)
based on the underlying [Medium Access Control (MAC) Technologies](202303301623.md) used.

Technologies that adopt UWB platform are:
- Native [IP-based](202206151223.md) application that is based on the WiMedia
  Convergence Platform
- Wireless USB based on Megabit UWB (MB UWB)
- Wireless IEEE 1394 with protocol adaptation layer (PAL) as the virtual
  interface used by UWB
