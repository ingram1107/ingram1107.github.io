# Wireless Transaction Protocol (WTP)

WTP is a connection-oriented [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
[Protocol](202209302229.md) like [TCP](202206151232.md) but with optional
user-to-user reliability and out-of-band data on
[acknowledgements](202303141902.md). It supports three classes of transaction
service, each of these could be asynchronous: *unreliable one-way requests*,
*reliable one-way requests*, and *reliable two-way requests replay transaction*.
Further optimisation are done by [Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)
concatenation and delay acknowledgement like in TCP (RFC 1122) to reduce the
number of messages in the [pipeline](202303141909.md).
