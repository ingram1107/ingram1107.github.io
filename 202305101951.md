# Inter-Symbol interference (ISI)

ISI happens when a narrow pulse is sent at a given frequency between fixed
antenna and [mobile unit](202303292141.md). A channel may deliver multiple
copies at different times, in which the delayed pulses become a noise for bit
information recovery. In addition, the timing changes as the mobile unit moves.
