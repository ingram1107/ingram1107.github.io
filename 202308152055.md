# Genome

Genome is the collection of [DNA](202308082154.md) within an organism which
includes a set of genes that encode RNA molecules and
[proteins](202308082207.md). It contains biology information needed to build and
maintain a living of an organism, and is encoded by DNA and later divided into
[Genes](202308091142.md). In short, it could be said that a genome is the sum
total of DNA of an organism.

In human DNA, only 1 to 2% of genome are compose of genes, others are of type of
introns, retrotransposons, and non-coding RNAs. Non-coding DNAs serve as
regulators of [Gene Expression](202308091143.md), introns, telomeres, and genes
for tRNAs. In fact, $\frac{1}{4}$ of the genome codes are introns and
gene-related regulatory sequence.

**Note**: Note that protein or RNA coding genes are not repetitive.
