# Comparative/Homology Modelling

Comparative modelling is a [sequence-sequence alignment](202308161006.md) used
for a [protein](202308082207.md) target that shares substantial similarity (more
than 25%) to other proteins of [known structure](202310291653.md). It builds
model from [Homologous](202308160957.md) structures, as template to model a
protein of unknown structure with known sequence through sequence alignment. The
structure prediction is made through placing residues into corresponding
position of known homologous protein structure models. The assumption made is
that homologous proteins fold in similar fashion. The higher the similarity, the
more confidence in the modelled structure. That being said, it is limited by the
large number of proteins and [Open Reading Frames (ORFs)](202308142028.md) that
have no similarity to the proteins with known structure.

**Note**: In comparative modelling, template is treated as sequence.

This method will first perform template selection and fold assignment from the
[Structure Databases](202308152117.md). Next, the target is aligned with the
template. Later, the model is built and refined by rigid-body assembly and
segment matching. The model is evaluated and in the end, the structure is
validated. Possible errors include error in side-chain packing, distortions
within correctly aligned regions, error in regions of target that lack a match
to a template, sequence alignment, and the use of incorrect template.

Examples of comparative modelling are:
- PSI-BLAST
- HMM
- Smith-Waterman #algorithm
