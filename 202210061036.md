# Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM)

MITM is a #[known plaintext attack](202209281257.md) on an
#[encryption](202209281130.md) scheme by obtaining the ciphertext **in between**
*two encryption algorithms*, and comparing the encrypted output from the plaintext
and decrypted output from the final ciphertext. This process could be further
understood with the following equation:

$$
X = E_{K1}(P) = D_{K2}(C)
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the ciphertext produced in between two encryption algorithms
- $E$ is the encryption algorithm
- $D$ is the decryption algorithm
- $K$ is the subkey used
- $P$ is the plaintext
- $C$ is the final ciphertext

It is done by encrypting P with all possible key $K1$ and store them into a
table $E_{K1}(P)$. Then compute $D_{K2}(C)$ for each possible $K2$ until a match
to $X$ is found in the table.

It utilises the [Feistel Cipher Structure](202210052211.md)# characteristic
where ciphertext could be decrypted as the same way which plaintext is
encrypted, only with a reverse order of subkeys.
