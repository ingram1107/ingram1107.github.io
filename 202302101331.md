# Relational Model

Relational Model is a [Data Model](202302101219.md) that uses a collection of
[tables](202304191954.md), aka [relation](202204282024.md), which consists of
[Set](202204281446.md) of [tuples](202204281552.md), i.e., rows, where elements
are related to each other. Table, thus, is used to represent both data and the
[Relationship](202304192107.md) among them where each table has multiple columns
and each column has a *distinguishable name*. In Relational Model, each table
contains records of a particular type that define a **fixed** number of fields
or [Attributes](202304200943.md). The column represents the *attributes* of the
record type. *Relation instance* refers to a specific set of rows. Since the
close relationship between relational model and mathematical notation of
relation, we can represent the following table with the tuple:

| dept_name  | building | budget |
| ---        | ---      | ---    |
| Biology    | Watson   | 90000  |
| Comp. Sci. | Taylor   | 100000 |
| Elec. Eng. | Taylor   | 85000  |
| Finance    | Painter  | 120000 |
| History    | Painter  | 50000  |
| Music      | Packard  | 80000  |
| Physics    | Watson   | 70000  |

The tuple that can represent the above table is: *department(<u>dept_name</u>,
building, budget)*. This is the *relation schema* for the above table, which
includes a list of attributes (columns) and their corresponding *domains*. In
relational model, domain refers to a set of permitted values for an attribute
(column). If the domain is indivisible (i.e., can't be broken down into smaller
units), then the domain can be said to be *atomic*. Whether the domain is
indivisible or not is a matter of how we treat the data. Notice that the
attribute *dept_name* is underlined. This is to indicate that it is chosen as
the *primary key* for the relation, as it is the *candidate key*, that is the
minimal *superkeys* that allow us to **uniquely** identify a tuple in the
relation. A superkey can consists of one or multiple attributes, as long as it
can identify a unique tuple. As long as *dept_name* remained as the primary key
for the table, it must be unique and part of it (if it consists of multiple
candidate keys) can't be null. This is the **entity integrity constraint**.

**Note**: The structure of the primary key depends on the [Mapping Cardinality](202304290909.md).

**Note**: Derived attributes can't be represented in relational model.

**Note**: As for complex attribute like composite attribute, the conversion norm
of the E-R model to relational schema is to break them into multiple simpler
attributes if it is not a multivalued attribute. If the latter is the case,
another relational schema must be created for the multivalued attribute
including primary key of the [Entity Set](202304191956.md) or [Relationship Set](202304200933.md)
as the foreign key in the new schema.

**Note**: In the case of an entity set that have only a single primary key and a
multivalued attribute, it can be dropped as it is retained in other schema with
attribute B and attribute A correspond to the multivalued attribute. This does
simplify the database system with the drawback related to foreign keys.

Let's say we have another relation schema for instructors:
*instructor(<u>id</u>, name, dept_name, salary)*. There is a duplicate attributes
between the relation *department* and *instructor*, that is the primary key
*dept_name*. Such duplication denotes a relationship between two different
relations. The attribute in a relation that refers to another primary key in
other relation is called *foreign key*. The relation that has the foreign key is
called the *referencing relation*, and the relation is that referred by the
foreign key is called *referenced relation*. To enforce that a department must
have at least an instructor, it requires that if the value of the attribute
*dept_name* appears in the relation *instructor*, the tuple that contains the
same value must be appeared in the relation *department*. As such, we cannot
declare a foreign key constraint from *department* to *instructor*, but we can
define a foreign key constraint other way around. This is called the
**referential integrity constraint** or *subset dependencies*.
