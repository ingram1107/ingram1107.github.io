# Relational Model

Relational Model is a [Data Model](202302101219.md) that uses a collection of
tables, aka [relation](202204282024.md), which consists of
[Set](202204281446.md) of [tuples](202204281552.md), i.e., rows, where elements
are related to each other. Table, thus, is used to represent both data and the
relationships among them where each table has multiple columns and each column
has a *distinguishable name*. In Relational Model, each table contains records
of a particular type that define a **fixed** number of fields or attributes. The
column represents the *attributes* of the record type. *Relation instance*
refers to a specific set of rows. Since the close relationship between
relational model and mathematical notation of relation, we can represent the
following table with the tuple:

| dept_name  | building | budget |
| ---        | ---      | ---    |
| Biology    | Watson   | 90000  |
| Comp. Sci. | Taylor   | 100000 |
| Elec. Eng. | Taylor   | 85000  |
| Finance    | Painter  | 120000 |
| History    | Painter  | 50000  |
| Music      | Packard  | 80000  |
| Physics    | Watson   | 70000  |

The tuple that can represent the above table is: *department(<u>dept_name</u>,
building, budget)*. This is the *relation schema* for the above table, which
includes a list of attributes (columns) and their corresponding *domains*. In
relational model, domain refers to a set of permitted values for an attribute
(column). If the domain is indivisible (i.e., can't be broken down into smaller
units), then the domain can be said to be *atomic*. Whether the domain is
indivisible or not is a matter of how we treat the data. Notice that the
attribute *dept_name* is underlined. This is to indicate that it is chosen as
the *primary key* for the relation, as it is the *candidate key*, that is the
minimal *superkeys* that allow us to **uniquely** identify a tuple in the
relation. A superkey can consists of one or multiple attributes, as long as it
can identify a unique tuple.

Let's say we have another relation schema for instructors:
*instructor(<u>id</u>, name, dept_name, salary)*. There is a dupliate attributes
between the relation *department* and *instructor*, that is the primary key
*dept_name*. Such duplication denotes a relationship between two different
relations. The attribute in a relation that refers to another primary key in
other relation is called *foreign key*. The relation that has the foreign key is
called the *referencing relation*, and the relation is that referred by the
foreign key is called *referenced relation*. To enforce that a department must
have at least an instructor, it requires that if the value of the attribute
*dept_name* appears in the relation *instructor*, the tuple that contains the
same value must be appeared in the relation *department*. As such, we cannot
declare a foreign key constraint from *department* to *instructor*, but we can
define a foreign key constraint other way around. This is called the
**referential integrity constraint** or *subset dependencies*.
