# System Architecture

System architecture defines the [System's](202303242148.md) high-level structure
which exposes its overall organisation as a collection of
[interacting](202303242118.md) components. Elements of system architecture
includes components, connectors, systems, properties, constraints, and styles.
Most system architecture are designed with [Architecture Description Language (ADL)](202303242159.md)
to have a planned, formal, and generic architecture design.
