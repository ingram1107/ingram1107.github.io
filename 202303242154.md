# System Architecture

System architecture defines the [System's](202303242148.md) high-level structure
which exposes its overall organisation as a collection of
[interacting](202303242118.md) components. Elements of system architecture
includes [components](202303250940.md), [connectors](202303250943.md),
[Systems](202303242148.md), [properties](202303250953.md),
[constraints](202303250956.md), and [styles](202303250958.md). The ultimate aim
of the system architecture is to satisfy the [Requirements](202303251303.md) and
prepare for easy modification or tweaking to meet potential new requirements in
the future. Most system architecture are designed with [Architecture Description Language (ADL)](202303242159.md)
to have a planned, formal, and generic architecture design.
