# Rust Raw Pointer

Raw pointer in Rust, unlike [Rust Smart Pointers](202111301656.md), is not
bounded by [Rust Borrowing Rule](202206241126.md). It doesn't guarantee what's
it pointing is a valid memory address. Its value can be null, and no auto
clean-up after its end of lifetime.

Raw pointer trades memory safety for #performance or to interface other language
or #hardware.
