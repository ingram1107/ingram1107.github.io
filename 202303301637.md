# Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA)

TDMA utilises all [radio spectrum](202302161842.md) by assigning specific time
intervals for access permanently or temporarily according to the time slots.
This means that each user in TDMA have access to the full bandwidth of the
channel, but for a fraction of time. Therefore, it has a greater channel
efficiency due to great utilisation of quiet time. The base station can use the
same channel unit for multiple sessions. Since there is no need to transmit and
receive signals at the same time, [diplexer](202303311210.md) is not needed in
TDMA. Unlike [FDMA](202303301632.md), it only needs a radio frequency (RF)
carrier in the channel. It uses analogue modulation with a simple push-to-talk
protocol. It is designed for point-to-multipoint (single base station to
multiple user terminals) architecture.
