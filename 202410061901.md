# Regular Expression

The basic element in regular expression is an **atom**, which can be of any
character or special symbol. On [Linux](202204081225.md), there are two defined
regular expression format: *basic regular expression* and *extended regular
expression*. Basic regular expression is usually the default format for most
applications' find-and-match. In basic regular expression, special characters
like `+`, `?`, `{`, and `}` are treated literally, in contrast to extended
regular expression in which it treats those characters with special purpose.

There are options for various commands to enable extended regular expression on
Linux. For example, with `find` we can pass the flag `-regextype` with the
choice of `posix-extended` or `egrep`. `grep` also supports extended regular
expression with the option `-E` (`grep -E`).
