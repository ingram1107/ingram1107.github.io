# YUM

YUM provides simplified interface to [RPM](202409131538.md) and dependency
resolution to ease package management on [Red Hat Linux-based distro](202409131545.md).
The commands provided by YUM include `search`, `install`, `update`,
`check-update`, `remove`, `whatprovides` (find files owned by the package, also
works for yet to be installed package), `info`, and `clean` (clean cache in
`/var/cache/yum`, can be specified for `packages` or `metadata`).

YUM repositories are defined in a file of `.repo` in the directory
`/etc/yum.repos.d/`. It is recommended to manage those repositories via the
command `yum-config-manager`, which provides the flags `--add-repo` (from
`.repo` file), `--disable`, and `--enable`. We can list all repositories,
enabled or disabled, through the command `yum repolist all`.
