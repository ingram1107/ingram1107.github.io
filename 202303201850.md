# Voice over IP (VoIP)

There are needs of VoIP in order to have continuous audio sampling, digital
conversion, transmission over [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md) network
in the form of packets, and analogue conversion at the receiver for playback.

It is standardised by [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md)
and International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Standards proposed are
[Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)](202302201856.md), Media Gateway Control
Protocol (MGCP), [H.323 Protocol](202302201420.md), and H.248. All VoIP
signalling protocols must be able to interact with [Signalling System 7 (SS7)](202304092155.md)
so that devices using VoIP protocols are compatible to existing telephones.

VoIP is preceded by VoLTE as the latter uses the 4G networking infrastructure
that is more advance comparing to VoIP.
