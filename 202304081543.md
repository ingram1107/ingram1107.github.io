# Command Pattern

Command pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) declaring an interface
for request issuing. It encapsulates requests as objects and allow client
parameterisation for different requests, queue, or log requests in addition of
supporting undoable (or redo) operation. This provides access functionalities
without creating dependencies between implementation and user interface classes.

It is done by storing the previous state of the object when executing an
operation, and the undo operation simply restore such state. A check should be
done to check whether an operation is undoable, that is whether there is a net
effect of execution.
