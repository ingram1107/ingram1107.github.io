# Command Pattern

Command pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) declaring an interface
for request issuing. It encapsulates requests as objects and allow client
parameterisation for different requests, queue, or log requests in addition of
supporting undoable (or redo) operation. By such, it decouples the object that
invoke the operations from the object that performs them, thus make the command
classes easy to manipulate and extend. To execute the desired operation, the
user class should call the execute method from the command object. This provides
access functionalities without creating dependencies between implementation and
user interface classes.

Undoable command object is done by storing the previous state of the object when
executing an operation, and the undo operation simply restore such state. A
check should be done to check whether an operation is undoable, that is whether
there is a net effect of execution. If there is a worry about error accumulation
during the undos but you don't want to expose additional information,
[Memento Pattern](202302232319.md) comes in handy in storing more information
for command object later accesses. To store a list of undo and redo history, we
can utilise the [Prototype Pattern](202304081512.md) to clone the command object
into a history list without affecting the original command object's structure
and internal state.

The Gang of Four advised to use command pattern when:
1. There is a need to parameterise objects by action to perform (like callback
   function)
2. The command object's lifetime should be independent of the request so that we
   can specify, queue, and execute the requests at different time and/or
   delegate it to a different process.
3. Undoable operation is necessary.
4. Change logging is necessary.
5. The system should be structured around high-level operations that built on
   top of primitive operations to achieve uniform interface and great
   extensibility.

Command pattern typically involves 5 participants: *command class* (defines
interface for execution operation), *concrete command class* (binds receiver
object to an action, implements the execution that will invoke operations on a
receiver), *client* (creates concrete command object and sets its receiver),
*invoker* (asks the command to carry out the request), and *receiver* (knows how
to perform operations associated with carrying out a request). Based on project
[Requirement](202303251303.md), we can have a command class that merely binds a
receiver to actions, implements everything by itself without delegating to a
receiver, or anything in between. When a command object implicitly know its
receiver, or it should be independent of the existing classes since there is no
suitable receiver, the command object may not need the receiver as a parameter
at all, that is all operations are done in the class itself.

Usually, the client will create a corresponding concrete command object and
specify its receiver (may be optional as discussed before). An invoker then
stores the concrete command object, before issuing a request with the execute
method from the command object. Finally, the command object will invoke the
operations on the receiver set earlier and delegate the rest of the operations
to it.

This pattern can be used in information system that support transactions which
encapsulates a set of data changes. Combining with [Composite Pattern](202302101843.md),
we could implement a macro command object that execute a list of command
objects.
