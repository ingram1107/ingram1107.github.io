Two #[202204281244](202204281244.md) are logical equivalence when they share the same
[truth values](202205061151.md)# for all situation. For example: $p$ and $\sim (\sim p)$ are logical equivalence. The following is their truth table:

$p$ | $\sim p$ | $\sim (\sim p)$
---|---|---
T | F | T
F | T | F

Their relationship can be denoted $p \equiv \sim (\sim p)$. More logically
