# Logical Equivalence

Two #[Mathematical Statement](202204281244.md) are logical equivalence when they
share the same [truth values](202205061151.md)# for all situation. For example:
$p$ and $\sim (\sim p)$ are logical equivalence. The following is their truth
table:

$p$ | $\sim p$ | $\sim (\sim p)$
---|---|---
T | F | T
F | T | F

Their relationship can be denoted $p \equiv \sim (\sim p)$. More logically
equivalence examples in [The Laws of Logic](202205061240.md)#.
