# Product Cipher

Product Cipher is a cipher that composed of both
#[substitution](202209281136.md) (S-box) and #[permutation](202210052159.md)
(P-box). Introduced by Claude Shannon, it is the backbone for the modern
[Block Cipher](202209281239.md). It provides **diffusion** and **confusion** of
message and key.

The diffusion is done by the P-box (with the help of special function) which
disperses statistical structure of plaintext over bulk of ciphertext, meaning
each single plaintext could affect many ciphertext bits. S-box is responsible
for making the relationship between ciphertext and the key as complex as
possible, preferably non-linear relationship, thus forges confusion into the
message and key.
