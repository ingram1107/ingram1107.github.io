# Requirement Modelling

[Requirement](202303251303.md) modelling is a process of system
[Project](202303251004.md) [fact gathering](202303251331.md),
[documentation](202304011057.md) preparation, model creation that will be used
to design and develop the [System](202303242148.md). It provides a way to
visualise the system design and ease the requirement checking (business
functionality, end-users needs, scalability, robustness, #security,
extensibility) before implementation to avoid expansive changes later. We could
use modelling and fact-finding methods interactively. It can be a medium of
communication for understanding the system requirements or business rules and
how will the users use such system.

Modelling represents the system at various development stages by using
non-technical, generic language (to be adaptive) and graphical methods or
diagrams stated below:
- Functional Decomposition Diagram (FDD, top-down representation of functions or
  processes)
- Business Process Model (BPM, represents business processes)
- Data Flow Diagram (DFD, describes how system stores, processes, and transforms
  data) or Context Diagram
- [Unified Modelling Language (UML) Diagram](202304011211.md)
