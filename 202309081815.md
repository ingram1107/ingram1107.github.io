# Malaysian Constitution

Malaysian constitution, initially drafted by Reid Commission, contains 15 parts,
182 articles about executive, legislative, and judicial power, Islam,
citizenship, official language, and aboriginal people's (Bumiputera) privileges.
Important lines in this constitution that shapes the current Malaysia political
atmosphere are Article 38(4) (position of Kings, Malay, and Islam as sensitive
issue), 3 ([Islam](202308151847.md) as Federation's religion), 160 (definition
of Malay, who must follow Islam, speak in Malay, and follow Malay customs), and
153 (Yang-DiPertuan Agung has the right to protect Malay privilege).

Before the drafting of Malaysian constitution, there existed Islamic laws and
constitution in other states that influenced or formed a basis for their modern
counterpart. This includes Malacca Law (Hukum Kanun Melaka), Malacca Maritim Law
(Undang-undang Laut Melaka), Terengganu Inscription 1303 (Prasasti Terengganu),
Johor State's Constitution 1895 (Perlembagaan Negeri Johor), Terengganu
Constitution (Perlembagaan Terengganu). It was the result of the failure of
Malayan Union pushed by the British colonial government on the Malay Peninsular
in which the kings' sovereignty were nullified and citizenship as Jus Soli.
