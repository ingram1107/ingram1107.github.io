# Linux File Types

#[Linux](202204081225.md) follows the [Unix Philosophy](202207142105.md) where
almost all things are treated as a file. The file could be:
- a *regular file* that contain encoded characters
- a *directory* which contains names and i-node numbers of the other files
- a *character* or *block* special file that represent I/O devices
- a *FIFO file* to indicate a named pipe file (with a prefix `p`)
- a *symbolic link* that point to other file (with a prefix `l`)
- a *socket file* for network connections
