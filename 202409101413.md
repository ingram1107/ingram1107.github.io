# Proportional, Integral, and Derivative Controller (PID)

PID is a [Controller](202409101358.md) that includes data about how quickly the
system is approaching the desired output. It is an efficient way to implement
feedback control.

Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices can be used to implement PID controllers.
