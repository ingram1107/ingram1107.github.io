# Network Security

Network Security is a measure whether the data is protected during transmission.
This could be strengthen by *preventing physical and unauthorised remote access
to network devices*, *specialised firewall systems*, *Access Control Lists
(ACL)*, *Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)*, and [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](202207150909.md)#.
For home user, it can be done using antivirus, antispyware, and firewall
filtering.

Basically, users need to be aware of [Network External Threat](202210012211.md)#
and [Network Internal Threat](202210012215.md)#.

Consequences of not being able to secure the Network transmission:
- network outages
- stealing of intellectual property
- compromise of personal information
- loss of person or business funds
- loss of important data

There are two models for Network Security:
- with [Encryption and Security Applications](202210022244.md)#
- [Firewall](202210022249.md)#
