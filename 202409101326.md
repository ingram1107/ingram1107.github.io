# Securing Wi-Fi Usage

To secure [Wi-Fi](202303292155.md) within own perimeter, one first has to change
the default administrator password and the network service set identifier (SSID)
for the [Router](202207061800.md). Such SSID must not be advertised to the
outside world if necessary. To further secure the local network, create a guest
wireless network and enable the built-in [Firewall](202301211140.md). Employ
[WPA2](202303021606.md). Keep the router's firmware updated. We can use
[Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md) filtering. Disable remote
management feature of the router. And lastly, make sure that the router is
physically secured.
