# OpenFlow

OpenFlow is a #communication [Protocol](202209302229.md) that provides interface
between the control and data plane of an [SDN](202305152046.md) architecture. It
provides separation of control and data planes, centralisation of control,
[flow based control](202209302245.md), and direct access to and manipulation of
the forwarding plane, physical or virtual, of [Network Devices](202207051821.md).
In management plane of SDN, OpenFlow allows programmability by enabling
innovation or differentiation and accelerating new features and services
introduction. It can centralise the intelligence, that is provides the whole
picture, of control plane by simplifying provisioning, optimising #performance,
and granular policy management. In data plane, it provides abstraction by
decoupling the #hardware and #software, control plane and forwarding, physical
and logical #configuration.

Examples of OpenFlow switch software are:
- Indigo
- LINC
- Pantou
- Of13softswitch
- Open vSwitch

Examples of controller plane software are:
- POX (deprecated)
- IRIS
- MUL
- NOX
- Jaxon
- Trema
- Beacon
- Floodlight
