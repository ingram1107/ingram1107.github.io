# Common Problem in Finding Longest or Shortest Path in Non-acyclic Graph

In #[finding the shortest path](202204141149.md), it is quite easy to get into the
so called *negative-cost cycles*, where one could stay in a loop forever if
there is a negative weight edge in the graph.

The opposite is true, as in finding the longest path in a non-acyclic graph
could result in *positive-cost cycles*.
