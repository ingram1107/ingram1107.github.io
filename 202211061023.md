# Rail Fencer Cipher

Rail Fencer Cipher is a #[Permutation/Transposition Cryptographic](202210052159.md)
#algorithm by writing message letters out diagonally over a number of rows
(arbitrary) then read off the cipher row by row.

A [Cryptanalysis](202209281128.md) could be done to this cipher by simply
analysing the number of characters used in the ciphertext and guess the number
of rows it's using.
