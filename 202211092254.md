# Security Association (SA)

SA is a *one way* relationship between a sender and a receiver. This means that
it only defines one communication link between a source and a destination over
an application. If multiple applications or #p2p secure communications are
needed, there needs to be multiple SA correspondingly. It is identified by three
parameters: **Security Parameter Index (SPI)** (a bit string to enable the
receiver to select the SA under which a received packet will be processed), **IP
Destination address** (allows only unicast address), and **Security Protocol
Identifier** (either AH or ESP, see more in #[IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)).

There is a minimal database that includes information attached to each SA, for
instance:
- AH information including authentication algorithm, key, key lifetime etc.
- ESP information including encryption and authentication algorithm, keys,
  initialisation values, key lifetimes etc.
- Sequence number counter, which is used to generate the sequence number field
  in AH nad ESP
- Sequence counter overflow flag, which defines the operation when encounter a
  counter overflows (usually close the SA)
- Anti-replay window
- Lifetime of the SA
- #[IPsec](202210052208.md) protocol mode (tunnel or transport mode)
- Path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
- [IP Addresses](202206281021.md)# including source and destination
- Timestamp
- Traffic Type ([TCP](202206151232.md)# or [UDP](202206151759.md)#)
