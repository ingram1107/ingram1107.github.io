# Docker Image

[Docker](202110201636.md) Image is simply a template for building [Docker Container](202203281423.md).
It simplifies the software deployment in Linux distributions by the DevOps.

## CLI

There are various [Docker](202110201636.md) commands that interact with the
Docker Image.

We could download a specific image from [Docker Registry](202203251430.md) by
executing `docker pull {registry}/{username}/{image-name}` without having the
[container](202203281423.md) running. If specific version of image should be
pulled, define the tag in the format `{image-name}:{tag}`. Otherwise, it will
always pull the `latest` tag version of the image.

We could rename the image by using the command `docker image tag
{source-image}:{tag} {target-image}:{tag}`.

Listing all the local installed images could be achieved by calling the command
`docker images`.

To remove an image from the local machine, pass in the image name to the command
`docker rmi {image-name}`. However, all the containers that is dependent on this
image must not be running at the time the command called. If so, the image will
persist instead of being removed.
