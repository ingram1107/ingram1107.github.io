# High Performance Radio LAN Type 2 (HiperLAN2)

HiperLAN2 is a fast [wireless LAN technology](202302161710.md) that emphasise
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) defined in EN300652 and ETS300836 by
European Telecommunications Standards Institute Broadband Radio Access Network
(ETSI BRAN). It partly based on [Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](202304111937.md).

HiperLAN2 has a similar capacity, throughput, and used spectrum compare to
[IEEE 802.11a](202303292155.md), which are 54 Mbps, 32 Mbps, and 5GHz
respectively. The underlying implementation of physical layer of HiperLAN2 is
quite similar to IEEE 802.11a, with the difference that it deploys [Dynamic TDMA](202303301637.md).

Each node in HiperLAN2 has HIPERLAN ID (HID) and a Node ID (NID) to uniquely
identifies the station. Mobile terminals and [access points](202304061549.md)
must authenticate each other. [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
is deployed to encrypt the communications.

It has several advantages over its IEEE counterpart, including high and scalable
capacity (against number of system users), managed bandwidth with predictable
performance for each user and application, throughput-optimised protocol on
available radio resource, and the ease of use (autoconfiguration tools).
