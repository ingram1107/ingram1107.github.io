# Newton Method

Newton Method is a root-finding method that can be used to calculate the
approximation to the roots or zeroes that lead to more accurate solution. The
following shows the formulae:

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
$$

It can be iterated for several times in order to get a more accurate value.
