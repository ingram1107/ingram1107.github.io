# Docker

Docker is a #[202204071114](202204071114.md) technology that exposes its API in
order to work with the containers. It utilises the [Linux Container (LXC)](202204071041.md)#
container technology. Lately, it also integrates WASM as a light alternative to
LXC.

An installed package of Docker commonly consists of three parts:
- [202203281416](202203281416.md)#
- [REST API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41)
- Docker daemon

Docker has a layered architecture where each layer could be reused for different
containers. It mainly consists of two main layers: *container layer* and *image
layer*. See [202110201654](202110201654.md)# for more details.

To build a Docker container, it generally needs two files:
- [202110201654](202110201654.md)#
- [202110201655](202110201655.md)#

Docker stores its information in /var/lib/docker. Its directory structure looks
like the following:

```
/var/lib/docker/:
  aufs/
  containers/
  image/
  volumes/
```

On the above, `aufs` could be any running storage driver supported by
[202203251354](202203251354.md)# that store its information. `containers` stores
information about #[202204071114](202204071114.md). `image` stores information
about [202202211632](202202211632.md)#. `volumes` store any
[202203251354](202203251354.md)#.
