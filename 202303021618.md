# Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

WPA is a four-way handshake process to generate a pairwise temporal key (PTK)
that is encrypted for [WLAN](202302161710.md) connection. First, WPA
authenticator sends a [randomly generated](202207162147.md)
[Nonce](202210211901.md) to the client, in which the client reply with another
nonce called (MIC) that used with the nonce sent to generate the pairwise
temporal key (PTK). The authenticator will indicate that the MIC and GTK is
ready to use, then the client should respond with OK to use the PTK for this
connection session.
