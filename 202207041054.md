# Model-View-Controller (MVC)

MVC is an #[decoupling](202202041514.md) idiom that *separates* the model from
the view and the controller that manage the view. In this page, the *model* is
defined as the abstract data model, for it to be a variable or #data-structure,
that represent the target object which can be from multiple form of sources.
*View* is defines as the user interface, either GUI, TUI or CLI, to the model,
which could be nested. In other way, it is the interpretation of the model.
*Controller* is the way or mean to handle the view and sometime could supply the
model with new data.

**Note**: Model should be easy to be parsed and read.

**Note**: Controller can be a mean to prevent overwhelming information due to
the viewers (filtered models) to increase the [usability](202206201428.md)#.

Each model may have multiple viewers, and each viewer may interact with multiple
models. This is a many-to-many relationship.

With the combination of the concept #[Publish/Subscribe Protocol](202207041109.md),
we can treat model as the *event*, view as the *subscriber* to the events and
controller as the *publisher* of those events. Since the controller has the
ability to provide new data to the model, there could be the case it is, too, a
publisher to the model.

Although in the hierarchy, the view is higher than the model, they can be the
models for the higher-level objects.

A theoretical better alternative to the MVC model is the
