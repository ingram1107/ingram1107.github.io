# Session Key

Session key is a temporary key used for encryption of data between users. It
will be discarded once the session is over, hence the name. Its lifetimes should
be limited to enhance security for [Symmetric Key Distribution](202210062203.md).
It is recommended to use different types of Session Keys on the basis of use.
