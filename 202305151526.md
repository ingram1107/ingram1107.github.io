requires the backing of legitimate and logical theory and slowly changing

  [usability](202303242139.md) as effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction
  measures)
- Standard and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM)
- Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, food safety)
- ISO 9001
