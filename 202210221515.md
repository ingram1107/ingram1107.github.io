# File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

An FTP session consists of two parallel [TCP](202206151232.md) connections
(out-of-band), one is control connection that send over control information, and
another one is data connection that send or receive the file. The control
connection persists until the end of the session where the client can initiate
commands such as `USER {username}` (send user identification), `PASS {password}`
(send user password), `LIST` (ask server to send a list of all files in the
current remote directory), `RETR {filename}` (to retrieve the specified remote
file), and `STOR {filename}` (to store the local file to the remote server).
Data connection, on the contrary, will be torn down for each file transferred.

FTP transfers password in plaintext, which is vulnerable to
[eavesdropping](202209261916.md)#.
