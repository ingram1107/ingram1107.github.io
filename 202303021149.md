# Xeros Network Systems (XNS)

XNS is the [Protocol Suite](202209302301.md) developed by Xerox Corporation,
particularly widely supported by 4.3BSD systems. Most Xerox applicatino are
built using the Courier [Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)](202302161128.md) protocol
operated in [Session Layer](202206131849.md) and [Presentation Layer](202206131853.md).
Most XNS network operates on [Ethernet](202207051550.md).

Examples of XNS protocols are:
- Echo Protocol (ECHO, the host simply echo the packet that it receives)
- [Routing Information Protocol (RIP)](202210160908.md)
- [Packet Exchange Protocol (PEX)](202303021224.md)
- [Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP)](202303021209.md)
- Error Protocol (ERROR, to report error and packet discard)
- [Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP)](202303021157.md)

XNS protocols define *bridge field* in the headers that are encapsulated by each
layer but is not intended to be used by that layer. Instead, it should be used
by the next higher layer. For example, *packet type* in [Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP)](202303021157.md)
can be used by [Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP)](202303021209.md) to know that
it is other protocol packet and not an SPP data packet.
