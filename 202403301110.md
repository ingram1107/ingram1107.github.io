# Sequential Consistency

Sequential consistency in [Computer Architecture](202403151651.md) states that
the execution order of a program in one processor is the same as the program
order, and the execution order in different processor is undefined. Sequential
consistency assumes consistent and uniform memory view.

**Note**: x86 and x86-64 can be viewed as sequential consistent, but a more
accurate description should be [processor consistent](202403301121.md).

Maintaining sequential consistency can lead to poor performance and complex
cache interaction machinery especially in a motherboard where there are more
than four CPU.

Alpha, PowerPC (PPC), Itanium, and sometimes SPARC are not considered to be a
sequential consistent computer architecture. In order to synchronise their
processes and/or threads, they can use [memory barriers](202207171457.md).
