# Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)

Cisco IOS is a collection of network operating systems used on Cisco
[Network Devices](202207051821.md)#, usually stored at the flash of the device
or [TFTP](202303021112.md) server. It can be used from input and output devices.
It also provides the mean for memory management, process management, file
systems management, security management, hardware management, network interface
configuration, and enabling [routing](202207061815.md)# and
[switching](202207051907.md)# functions.

~~ROM of the device will be used to partially boot up IOS by waking up the
bootstrap program. Otherwise, it could be also used to perform power-on self
test (POST) diagnostics. The flash of the device is used to store, locate and
load IOS. Unless it doesn't function, then Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
will be the second choice where the IOS will be transferred. The configuration
file could be found in NVRAM, console and/or TFTP server. We can enter setup
mode via them too.~~

~~We could access an IOS device's command line interface (CLI) using either its
console (by connecting to its console port with RJ-45/mini-USB to Serial/USB
rollover cable), Telnet or [Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md)#, or auxiliary
port (uses telephone line).~~

The emulation of IOS for different devices could be seen in #[Cisco Packet Tracer](202210132259.md).

## Modes of Operations

There are several modes of operations in IOS which we can access via the console
with built-in commands. They are **User EXEC**, **Privileged EXEC**, **Global
Configuration**, **Interface Configuration**, **Sub-Interface Configuration**,
**Routing Engine Configuration**, **Line Configuration**, **Controller
Configuration**, **Map-List Configuration**, **Map-Class Configuration**,
**Router Configuration**, **IPX-Router Configuration**, **Route-Map
Configuration**, **Setup**, and **ROM Monitor**.

The following sections describe the commands used in these modes of operation.
Additionally, we can add a `?` to the end of an incomplete command in order to
get hints on using the command or finding a command.

### User EXEC

User EXEC is the default mode for an IOS device.

- `ping`
- `show`
- `enable` (enter Privileged EXEC, can shorten as `en`)
- `traceroute`

### Privileged EXEC

Privileged EXEC could be entered via the command `enable` in User EXEC. It
includes all User EXEC and debugging commands excepts the following:

- `reload`
- `show`, with subcommands `running-config` (show the system details) and `ip
  route` (shows [Routing Table](202210112056.md)#)
- `copy`, commonly `copy running-config startup-config` to save the
  configurations
- `erase`, with subcommands `startup-config` (remove configurations)
- `reload` (reload the system)
- `configure terminal` (enter Global Configuration, can shorten as `conf t`)
- `disable` (exit Privileged EXEC)

### Global Configuration

Global Configuration will show up when the command `configure` is executed in
Privileged EXEC. From here, we can configure the settings for the
[Network Device](202207051821.md)#.

- `hostname` (set host name of the device)
- `enable secret` (set password for Privileged EXEC)
- `ip route` ([Static Routing](202211051028.md)#)
- `interface`, with subcommands `ethernet`, `serial`, `dsl` etc. (enter
  Interface Configuration)
- `router`, with subcommands `rip`, `ospf`, `eigrp` etc. (enter Routing Engine
  Configuration)
- `line`, with subcommands `vty`, `console` etc. (enter Line Configuration)
- `end` (to end the configuration, available too in other Configuration modes)
- `service password-encryption` (shows all the password configured in encrypted
  form)
- `banner motd` (set banner, typically used to warn entering users)
- `no ip domain-lookup` (disable [Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md)
  lookup).
- `ipv6 unicast-routing` (enable [IPv6](202206281129.md)# unicast forwarding)

### Interface Configuration

Interface Configuration could be entered via the command `interface` executed in
Global Configuration. It is where we could configure the network interface of
the device.

**Note**: We could define a range of interfaces with the same configuration by
running the command `interface range {interfaces}`, e.g., `interface range
f0/1-12, f0/18-24`.

- `ip address` (set static [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)#)
- `ipv6 address` (set static [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md)#)
- `encapsulation`
- `shutdown` (disable the interface)
- `no shutdown` (enable the interface and keep-alive mechanism)
- `bandwidth` (adjusting the bandwidth of the interface in Kb/s, useful in
  [Routing Protocol](202207061815.md) that use bandwidth as its metric)

### Routing Engine Configuration

Routing Engine Configuration could be entered via the command `router` executed
in Global Configuration. It is where we could configure the routing information.

- `network`
- `version`
- `auto summary`
- `passive interface` (prevent a router from sending updates through an
  interface)

### Line Configuration

Line Configuration could be entered via the command `line` executed in Global
Configuration. It is where we could configure the line access of the device
including modem commands.

- `password` (set password for the line)
- `login` (activates the password immediately)

**Note**: Console port should be secured from unauthorised access by physically
plugging in a cable to the device.
