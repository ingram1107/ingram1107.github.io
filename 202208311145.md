# Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)

ISDN is a set of technologies developed to carry voice, video, and data across
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) by existing telephone lines. It
utilises #[Circuit Switching](202207150846.md) and primarily operates at
[Physical Layer](202206131647.md)#, [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)# and
[Network Layer](202206131702.md)#. ISDN offers bandwidth from 128kbps up to
384kbps. It was the first ~~#[broadband](202208311155.md)~~
[Narrowband](202304041940.md) service deployed in the home but nowadays, it has
been outshone by [Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)](202208312036.md) and [Cable Modem](202208311843.md).

ISDN has 2 types of interfaces: **Basic Rate Interface (BRI)** and **Primary
Rate Interface (PRI)**. Each have an arbitrary number of bearer channels (B) and
exactly one delta channel (D). The former are capable of carrying voice, data,
or compressed video whereas the latter is responsible for carrying signal
(usually for call setup) and call control information, and sometimes low-rate
packet data such as alarms. Only after the establishing of a path between
switches, passing source and call numbers information by D channel and signalled
by destination that it is available, only can the B channels start the data
exchange.

BRI offers 2 64kbps B channels (thus its alternative name 2B+D). This means that
it has a bandwidth of 128kbps excluding D channel, which is 16kpbs wide. The
PRI's structure in the other hand depends on the region. In Europe, it has 30 B
channels (64kpbs each), but in North America and Japan it has only 23 B
channels.
