# Component Glue

Component Glue is one of the [Component Interaction Patterns](202304302208.md)
that solves component incompatibilities by using a scripting language to create
a glue code that mediates or adapts between components. The code ties the
components together without increasing coupling and the creation of new
component (unless is frequently used)which can be an alternative to [Adapter Pattern](202303131324.md).
