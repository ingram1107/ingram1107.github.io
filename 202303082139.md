# Network Admission Control (NAC)

Build on top of identity-based networking service (IBNS), that is identity the
user credential, NAC provides additional services such that devices attempt to
connect to the network must fulfil certain criteria based on the security
policy. The device is challenged by the network with NAC protocol in which it
needs to provide *health credentials* to the network. If the policy server sees
the device is in compliance, then the network access is granted, otherwise it
might be redirected to quarantined network section that has access to
remediation servers or granted only guest privilege (minimum access of the
Internet). This process is termed *challenged-and-response*.
