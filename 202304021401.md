# Multitier Applications Architecture

Multitier applications architecture divides functionalities into separate tier,
mainly three: **top tier**, **middle tier**, and **bottom tier**. The top tier
consists of the applications' UI that gathers user input and displays server
output. Middle tier implements business logic, controller logic, and
presentation logic to control interactions between the application's clients and
data in bottom tier. In the bottom tier, application's data are maintained and
often stored in a [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md).

It can utilises [Client-Side Scripting](202304021406.md) and/or [Server-Side Scripting](202304021413.md)
to enhance the overall application user experience.
