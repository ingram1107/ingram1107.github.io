# Xen Virtualisation Model

Xen virtualisation model establishes an intermediary memory management agent,
that is [Hypervisor](202311161500.md) or Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), for Dom0
(privilege kernel) and DomU (unprivileged kernels). These domains' memory
handling doesn't have unrestricted access to physical memory, and they must
invoke hypervisor each time they update their own [Page Tables](202404022105.md)
(keep for each process), which is expensive. The hypervisor also have to create
its own page table tree (shadow page table tree) for each guest domain.

Intel and AMD come up with the solution to allows page table of the guest domain
to produce virtual physical address. These technologies are Extended Page Table
(EPT) and Nested Page Table (NPT) respectively. The address is translated with
EPT or NPT trees to actual physical address. It reduces the memory usage as only
one page table tree has to be created for each guest domain instead of process
running on them. The result of the address translation is then stored in
[Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)](202403210922.md), with the help of Virtual
Processor ID (VPID) or ASID to identify the guest.

This model has a huge shortcoming when coming to the efficiency of memory
handling as Xen hypervisor has to duplicate memory management implementation,
resulting in a two-layer memory handling.
