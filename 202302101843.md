# Composite Pattern

Composite Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that represent
part-whole hierarchies into #tree structure-like hierarchies where both simple
and composite objects can be abstracted and be used similarly. This means that
there will be no significant behavioural difference between a simple and nested
composite objects from the client's view point.

The Gang of Four suggested to use Composite Pattern when:
1. There is a need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
2. There is a need for clients to be able to neglect the differences between
   simple and composite objects and treat them uniformly.

An example real life use case of Composite Pattern is the original View class of
Smalltalk [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](202207041054.md).

This pattern involves three classes: *component*, *leaf*, and *composite* class.
Component class declares the interface for objects in composition, implements
default behaviour for the interface common to all classes, and declares an
interface for accessing and managing its child components. Optionally, it can
define as interface for accessing a component's parent in the recursive
structure and implements it. Leaf class represents the primitive objects, and it
defines their behaviours. Composite class defines the behaviour for components
having children, stores child components, and implements child-related
operations in the Component interface.

There are might be some in implementing such design pattern peculiarly when
some operations for composite are not necessarily needed by the leaves. In this
case, it is recommended to define a default operation on component class. For
children management routines, we can define a function `getComposite()` that
return nothing in component class and return itself in composite class. By this
way, we can retain the transparency without sacrificing much safety. Or we can
simply make such operations fail when it is used on a leaf class.

It uniforms the interface of simple and composite objects, so that client can
access it ignoring the underlying complexity. Furthermore, it is easier to
extend a new component to the hierarchies without changing the interface and/or
implementation of the other classes. That being said, Composite Pattern could
make the class design too generalised which makes imposing restriction on the
components of a composite class harder. Type system will not come into your aid
to enforce what kind of components can be instantiated in the composite class.

## Implementation

```cpp
class Component {
public:
  virtual ~Component();

  consat char* Name() { return _name; }

  // interface of operations for individual component ...

  // interface for Composite class
  virtual void Add(Component *);
  virtual void Remove(Component *);
  virtual Iterator<Component*>* CreateIterator();

protected:
  Component(const char*);

private:
  const char* _name;
};

class Leaf : public Component {
public:
  Leaf(const char*);
  virtual ~Leaf();

  // implement set of operations for individual component ...
};

class Composite: public Component {
public:
  virtual ~Composite();

  // interface of operations for individual component ...

  // define composition operations
  virtual void Add(Component *);
  virtual void Remove(Component *);
  virtual Iterator<Component*>* CreateIterator();

protected:
  Composite(const char*);

private:
  List<Component*> _equipment;
};
```
