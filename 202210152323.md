# Fix-Length Subnet Masking

Fix-Length Subnet Masking is a #[Subnetting](202206280939.md) technique utilises
the default subnet mask of an [Address Class](202206280922.md)#. All
non-reserved address classes has a default subnet mask, shown in the following
table:

| Classes | Default Mask  | Notation |
| ------- | ------------- | -------- |
| A       | 255.0.0.0     | /8       |
| B       | 255.255.0.0   | /16      |
| C       | 255.255.255.0 | /24      |

We can get the subnet bits if the give subnet mask is larger than the default.
Remember, the total bits used for #[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) is 32 bits.
We know that it is composed of 2 parts: **network mask bits** and **host bits**.
Thus, the following formulae:

$$
\begin{align}
TB &= BB + BL\\
BB &= \lg(n)
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $TB$ is the total bits of IPv4 address, which is 32 bits
- $BB$ is the total bits borrowed
- $BL$ is the total bits left
- $n$ is the total number of hosts needed to be assigned

**Note**: If $BB$ is of decimal, we should round it up to integer value.

Once we get $BB$, we could get the total number of assignable subnet using the
formula $2^{BB}$ (notice the similarity to the calculation for the total number
of network hosts) where $n$ denoted the number of subnet bits. To find out which
octet should we used, calculate how many times $BL$ could be divided by 256
until there is a remainder, which is the *magic number* itself. We can identify
the subnet by using the *first address* available in the subnet (similar to how
we can identify a network). The *last address* of the subnet is used for
broadcasting. This is based on the [assumption](202401042152.md)

However, using such addressing scheme can result in a rather wasteful host
allocation, and it is prone to traffic confusion due to the result of route
summarisation. The solution for it is to adopt [Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)](202210162049.md).
