# Top-Down Information Assurance Approach

Top-down [Information Assurance](202408141942.md) approach mainly involves
senior management and executives on their perspective on organisation's
security. Requirements definition process is start from the top in order to
align with the business objectives. The justification to it is that it examines
the overall information assurance posture and the immediate
[controls](202408221618.md) required.

To implement such approach, first, we have to develop and present an approved,
shared, and documented strategic plan as a basic reference for continuous
efforts. Senior executives should know priority areas for control (threats and
risks to critical assets) before we green light the implementation of [Security Controls](202408221618.md)
through all organisational layers from the top.

The benefits of adapting top-down information assurance policy is that it
encourages and ease integration between different elements when it receives
support from senior leadership. However, due to internal bureaucracy, it can
take times for approval, which may resulted in poor technical decisions and
out-of-date solution. One solution to this problem is by deploying a rapid
enforceable decision-making process such as change management boards.

This approach is mandatory when [Outsourcing](202304161611.md) or
[cloud](202210012158.md) strategy is being adopted by the organisation. Senior
leadership must set the tone surrounding security expectations of any business
partner, outsource solution, or cloud provider, and responsible for the
performance of security functions of their cloud or outsourcing partners.

Frameworks such as ISACA, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), and NIST can help.
