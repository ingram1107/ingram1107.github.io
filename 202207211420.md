# Perl Logical Operators

Perl has two kind of logical operators: *pure operators* and *keywords*. Some
share the same function but with different precedence when interpreted by Perl.
The following table shows their function and similarity.

| Function | Pure Operator | Keyword |
| -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| AND      | `&&`          | `and`   |
| OR       | `âˆ¥`           | `or`    | 
| NOT      | `!`           | `not`   |
| XOR      |               | `xor`   |

Generally, keywords have *lower precedence* to both the pure operators and the
assignment operator (`=`), whereas pure operators have *higher precedence* over
the assignment operator. Therefore, a typical use of a keyword logical operator
is to use it as a method to *control flow*, rather than used together with an
assignment operator which could be confusing.

```perl
open (my $fileHandle, $fileName)
  or die "can't open the file $fileName"  # if fail, print out
                                          # the error message

my $wrongNumber = 0 or 1  # expected to be 1, but resulted in 0
                          # because `or` has lower precedence than `=`
```

If an assignment operator is involved, use pure logical operators instead of
keywords.
