# Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)

DWDM uses the same #[multiplexing](202209091312.md) technique as
[Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)](202209021746.md). However, compare
to CWDM ability to multiplex 8 signals, DWDM system is able to multiplex 32
signals into a single fibre. Additionally, the signals can be amplified, making
them keen to be transmitted up to 250 km. The conversion between electrical
signals and light are done by Fibre-Optic Transmission Systems (FOTS), which is
a [Modulator](202209291044.md).
