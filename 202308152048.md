# Phylogenetics

Phylogenetics is a study of the evolutionary history and relationships among or
within the groups of organisms.

The study's methods could be **phenetics** or distance-based that classifies
organisms based on morphological and structural features, or **cladistics** or
character-based that classifies organisms based on their ancestry and
evolutionary relationships. The distance could be **additive** or
**ultrametric**. Additive distance is calculated from the sum of the edge
lengths connecting two leaves, usually used for neighbour joining method. It can
be fitted to an unrooted tree. Ultrametric distance states that the distance
from the root to the leaves is the same for every leaf. It is particularly used
in UPGMA to fit into a rooted tree precisely.

Distance method requires distance measures derived from raw data which is
suitable for continuous characters. It is a rather fast method. The assumption
made is that similarity is kinship. Examples are:
- [Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)](202308220845.md)
- [Neighbour Joining (NJ)](202308221823.md)
- Minimum Evolution (ME)

Character method requires discrete characters instead, which is slower and
computationally intensive. Examples of this method are:
- Maximum parsimony
- Maximum Likelihood
