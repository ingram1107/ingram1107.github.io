PHP is a [Server-Side Scripting](202304021413.md) language. See the following
links for revision:
- [strcmp()](https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_strcmp.asp)
- [PHP Basic regex](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_regex.asp)
- [preg_match() parameters](https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_regex_preg_match.asp)

for grouping.
