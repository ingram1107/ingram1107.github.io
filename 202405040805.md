# Resource Access Control Protocol

Resource access control protocol defines a set of rules that regulate access to
shared resources, including scheduling. Its purpose is to eliminate
[Deadlocks](202202191853.md) by avoidance and handle [Priority Inversion Problems](202405040754.md)
more gracefully.

**Note**: Resource access control protocol can't solve priority inversion. The
most it can do is to keep the blocking time of higher priority tasks under
control.

Examples of resource access control protocol:
- [Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP)](202405040809.md)
- [Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP)](202405040822.md)
