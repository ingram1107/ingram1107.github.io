# Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)

The functionality of RARP is the exact reverse of [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](202209301002.md),
that is to map [Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md)# to
[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)#. It is especially useful for a diskless host to
obtain a valid IP address from its server.
