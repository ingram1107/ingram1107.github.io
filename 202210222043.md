# Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)

CRT is used to speed up [modulo](202210090858.md) computations by computing
smaller moduli $m_i$ in the [Set](202204281446.md) $\mod M = m_1 m_2 \ldots m_3$
instead of full modulus $M$.

For example, to compute $A (\mod M)$:
1. Do a [Prime Factorisation](202210221918.md) on $M$ to find out $m_i$
2. Calculate $M_i = M / m_i$
3. List a set of linear congruences using $M_i b_i = 1 (\mod m_i) \rightarrow
   r_i b_i$ where $r_i$ is $M_i \mod m_i$ and find out the
   [inverse](202210082303.md)# $r_i^{-1}$ which is $b_i$ at the same time
4. Knowing $c_i$ is actually $M_i b_i$, sums up the result with $A \equiv
   (\sum_{i=1}^k a_i c_i) (\mod M)$
