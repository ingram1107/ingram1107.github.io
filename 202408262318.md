# Information Assurance Management Program (IAMP)

A successful IAMP program can have continuous support and commitment from the
top management, direct involvement in the local security systems' planning from
employees, better understanding of the organisation by the executives to
effectively carry out their duties and protect information, securely manage
information assets, more awareness and familiarity with security requirements by
unit managers, and secure physical and logical access to IT infrastructure.
