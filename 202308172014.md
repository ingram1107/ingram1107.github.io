# Pairwise Sequence Alignment

Pairwise sequence alignment is a [Sequence Alignment](202308161006.md) that used
to find the best-matching sequences, either local or global, alignments of two
query sequences. It is used to find out the degree of similarity and the
possibility of homology between two sequences. It forms the basis of
[BLAST](202308161002.md) searching.
