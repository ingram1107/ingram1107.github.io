# XFree86

XFree86 is a [free](202110161030.md) and [open source](202110161031.md)
implementation of #[202205051624](202205051624.md). The name of its configuration name is
`XFreeConfig` or `XFreeConfig-4` (for version 4.x).

Older XFree86 (before version 4) does not support the section `SeverLayout` for
configuration. Within the configuration file, it also does not support for
options like `Indentifier` and `Driver`. Keyboard options should be stated
literally in the older version of XFree86.

Other than that, it shares the same configuration format as [202205051716](202205051716.md).

XFree86 stores the [202205051943](202205051943.md)# in the directory `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts`
Additionally, before version 4.x, it does not support
[TrueType](202205051735.md)#.
