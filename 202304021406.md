# Client-Side Scripting

Client-side scripting is a design decision to run scripts on user side, that is
the web browser. It can be used to validate user input, enhance web pages, and
add client or server communication between a browser and a web server. However,
this method is dependent on the browser and might have some #security issue
(opening external application).
