# Copyright

Copyright laws in digital era makes it illegal to look inside your computer when
certain applications is running, to share what have you found. It can censor
some Internet sites without proving it is wrong.

The lawmakers are doing so because they do not understand #[202203011205](202203011205.md).
They try to control the usability of a computer using #[202203011213](202203011213.md). They
are making unrealistic demands.

We could see copyright laws as the attempt of capitalists to further
[concentrate capital](202203051018.md)#. They are tying to relinquish the freedom
of what we could see and believe. They are not satisfied what they have owned,
instead they are interested in owning our personal property.
