# Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics, as defined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper, is the application
of informatics to biology. It involves computer science, biology, mathematics,
and engineering in order to analyse and interpret biological data.

To have a reproducible research, the work flow should be *well documented*, and
the related information stored should be well organised. The data should be made
available to others, stored in repositories that are able to store
high-throughput data. Metadata should not be neglected since it could be useful
for statistical analysis. [Databases](202302101139.md) and software used should
be documented which include their version numbers.
