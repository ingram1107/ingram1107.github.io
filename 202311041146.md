# Hybrid Application

Hybrid application is an application that runs #html, #css, and #javascript in
an internal browser call Web View within a native wrapper or container like
Apache Cordova. It can access native device APIs via #javascript. A native
bridge is needed in order to establish communication between Web View and the
Native Platform.
