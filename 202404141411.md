# State-Driven Code

State-driven code is a [Real-Time](202403301908.md) [Kernel](202210062254.md)
that uses nested conditional statements or finite state automaton (FSA) to
divide tasks into multiple code segments. The separation of processes allows
each to be temporarily suspended before completion without the loss of critical
data. Multitasking can be facilitated through other schemes such as
[Co-Routines](202404141417.md). It is particularly well when cooperate with
[Cyclic Code Structure](202404131912.md) if the tasks are too long or their size
are non-uniform.
