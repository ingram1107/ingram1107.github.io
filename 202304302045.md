# Quality Assurance (QA)

QA, defined by [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)](202210010828.md),
is a planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide adequate
confidence that the item or product conforms to established technical
[Requirements](202303251303.md). In short, we can say that assessing the
#software quality is to find the degree to which the attributes of the software
enable it to perform its specified end-item use. There are mainly three
approaches to QA, which are:
- [Structural Perspective QA](202304302137.md)
- [Functional Perspective QA](202304302141.md)
- [Purposeful Perspective QA](202304302143.md)
