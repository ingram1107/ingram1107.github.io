# Quality Assurance (QA)

QA, defined by [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)](202210010828.md),
is a planned and systematic pattern of all actions necessary to provide adequate
confidence that the item or product conforms to established technical
[Requirements](202303251303.md). In short, we can say that assessing the
#software quality is to find the degree to which the attributes of the software
enable it to perform its specified end-item use. The product quality is defined
by ISO as the totality of the characteristics of an entity that bear on its
ability to satisfy stated or implied needs (ISO 8042) or the degree to which a
set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements (ISO 9000). Generally, the
quality of a product is subjective, and usually based on the conformance to
requirements (project's processes and products adheres to written
specifications) and/or fitness to use (be used as intended). There are mainly
three approaches to QA, which are:
- [Structural Perspective QA](202304302137.md)
- [Functional Perspective QA](202304302141.md)
- [Purposeful Perspective QA](202304302143.md)
