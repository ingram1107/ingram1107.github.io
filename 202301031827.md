# Antivirus

There are four generations of Antivirus:
1. Scanners which search files to see if it matches any signatures found on any
   virus signature library and check executables for length changes
2. Heuristic Scanners which look for general signs (such as code segment) and
   check files for checksum or hash changes
3. Activity Traps which reside in memory and check for certain software
   behaviour pattern
4. Full Featured which combines the aforementioned techniques
