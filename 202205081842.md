# Linux Security Modules (LSM)

LSM is a #[202204081225](202204081225.md) framework that allows modules mediates
the access to internal objects in the [Kernel](202210062254.md). To do so, they
place hooks in the kernel code just before the access happen. They will impose
several checks against access to see whether the request is valid and legal. LSM
provides MAC-based controls without modifying the kernel.

The modules that could be used in LSM are:
- SELinux
- AppArmor
