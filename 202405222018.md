# Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)

PIC provides two functions on [Exception](202405222000.md) handling:
prioritising multiple interrupt sources and offloading the core CPU with
processing required to determine an interrupt's exact source. It has a set of
interrupt request (IRQ) lines where each of them are assigned a priority.

**Note**: PIC is implementation-dependent.

The exception priorities are usually come first with non-maskable
[Asynchronous Exception](202405222010.md), precise [Synchronous Exception](202405222002.md),
imprecise synchronous exception, then lastly, maskable asynchronous exception.
