# De Minimus Policy

A de minimus policy specifies that an employee may use organisational
information systems and resources for personal use during break or lunch period
as long as there is no material cost to the organisation.

The first issue that have to be addressed by the policymaker is to define
material cost, as such term can be subjective since simultaneous access to
information system from multiple employees contribute great bandwidth demand.
Another concern is that the person that is using the information is put under
surveillance which expose their personal lives to the lens of the organisation,
violating their privacy.
