# Docker CLI

Docker CLI is used to access #[202110201636](202110201636.md) REST API. It could be done within
a local host or from a remote client. Run `docker run -H={ip-addr}:{port}` if
you are accessing a Docker host remotely.

Typically, Docker CLI gives an interface to manage the following Docker's
components or objects:
- [202203281423](202203281423.md)#
- [202202211632](202202211632.md)#
- [202203251354](202203251354.md)#
- [202203251430](202203251430.md)#
