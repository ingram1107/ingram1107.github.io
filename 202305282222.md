# Free-Space Optics (FSO)

FSO, aka Fibreless Optics or Optical Wireless, is a [Wireless MAN (WMAN)](202303292150.md)
technology using lasers or light-emitting diode (LED, though lower quality) for
data transmission through air. The laser is characterised by central wavelength,
average power, and beam divergence angle. Due to easy disturbance from weather
conditions, light flashes, and solar interference, it is typically used for last
mile connections.

The operation of FSO is described in the following sentences. First, the light
is emitted from a transmitter which then propagates to reach an optical
receiver. A telescope at the receiver collects the incoming light, then focuses
it onto a photodetector that converts it into electric current. The electrical
signal is amplified and processed. Lastly, a decision-making device will
determine the nature of signal referring to its amplitude and arrival time.
