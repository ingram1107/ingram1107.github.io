# Perl Type Conversion

The conversion of type in Perl is quite simple: just combined the source type
with the target type. For instance, if the source type is of number type and we
want to convert it into a string, simply concatenate it with an empty string,
then it will turn into a string, such as follows:

```perl
my $number = 5.5;               # This is of number type
my $strNumber = $number .= '';  # Become '5.5'
```

**Note**: Operator `.=` indicates a string concatenation.

In reverse, if we want to convert a string into of number type, we can simply
add a 0 to it. It is shown below:

```perl
my $str = "5.5";               # This is of string type
my $numberFromStr = $str + 0;  # Become 5.5 instead of '5.5'
```

**Note**: The number is base 10. If there is a need to convert the string into
other base form, use the functions `oct()` or `hex()`.

This could be especially useful when trying to test a value's
