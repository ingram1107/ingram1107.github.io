# H.323 Protocol

H.323 [Protocol](202209302229.md), standardised by International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), for [multimedia](202302201418.md) communications,
particularly [voice](202303201850.md) and [video](202302201418.md), over a
[packet-switched network](202207150848.md). It specified the compression of
audio and video and provides efficient use of bandwidth with multicast and
bandwidth management. It is also #hardware or #operating-system independence.
Legacy H.320 protocol can connect to a video conference initiated by H.323.
