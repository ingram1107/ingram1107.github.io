# H.323 Protocol

H.323 is a set of [protocols](202209302229.md) standardised by International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), for multimedia communications, particularly
[voice](202303201850.md) and [video](202302201418.md), over a
[packet-switched network](202207150848.md). It specified the #compression of
audio and video, signalling setup, call management, transmission of multimedia
data while calling, binary messages to use ASN.1, message #encoding with basic
encoding rules (BER), #security, conference calls with multipoint control unit,
and server task handling (address resolution, [authentication](202210040915.md),
[Authorisation](202210221159.md), [Accounting](202210221202.md), call forwarding
etc.). H.323 provides efficient use of bandwidth with multicast and bandwidth
management. It is also #hardware or #operating-system independence. Both
[UDP](202206151759.md) (multimedia data) and [TCP](202206151232.md) are used for
transportation in H.323 protocols. Legacy H.320 protocol can connect to a video
conference initiated by H.323.

In this standard, H.323 defines alternative terminology and additional concepts
focusing on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) interaction as follows:
- *Terminal* which provides IP telephone function.
- *Gatekeeper* which is a single gateway interconnects the IP telephone system
  with the PSTN and handles signalling and media translation.
- *Gateway* which provides location and signalling functions, and coordinates
  the operation of the gateway to connect to the PSTN.
- *Multipoint control unit (MCU)* which provides services such as multipoint
  conferencing.
