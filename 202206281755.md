# C Resource Clean-Up in Multithreading Environment

To avoid duplicate object initialisation in #[multithreading environment](202207171457.md)
using [threads](202112061056.md)#, C standard library `threads.h` provides the
function `call_once` which has the following definition:

```c
void call_once(once_flag flag, void (*func)(void) );
```

`once_flag` is a flag is used to notify the function `call_once` that the
callback (defined as `void (*func)(void)` shown above) should only be called
exactly once. As such, we can avoid multiple attempts to initialise the same
object which in reality it just needs to be initialised one time.

For object destruction, it can be rather complicated if not using the function
`atexit` provided by the standard library `stdlib.h`. The definition is shown as
below:

```c
int atexit(void (*func)(void));
```

Notes the similarity of the **parameter** (`void (*func)(void)`) to the function
`call_once`. Pass any necessary callback that will be handling the resource
clean-up for the thread.
