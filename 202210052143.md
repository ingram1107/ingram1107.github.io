# Information Rate

Information Rate or Code Rate is the average number of *bits* of
#[Information](202209291015.md) are transmitted within a *second*. Thus, its
unit is in bit/second. It is formally defined as the following:

$$
R = rH
$$

Where:
- $R$ is the Information Rate
- $r$ is how much symbols are transmitted within a second (symbol/second)
- $H$ is the [Entropy](202209291005.md)#

Or in [Channel Coding Theorem](202209291049.md):

$$
r = k/n
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the Information Rate or Code rate
- $k$ and $n$ are defined in #[Block Code](202210290914.md) where $n > k$
