# Delay-Throughput Product

Delay-Throughput Product is a measure on the allowed data volume to be present
on the network. In other words, it measures the number of bits traverse through
a network at any given time. Like the name suggested, it is simply a product of
[Estimated Effective Delay](202304251518.md) and [Throughput](202304111957.md)
like the formula shown below:

$$
\text{Bits present in a network} = D \times T
$$
