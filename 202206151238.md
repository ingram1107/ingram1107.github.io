# Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)

TCP/IP is a #[Protocol Suite](202209302301.md) that is widely used for Internet
or other computer networks connection. [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)#
forms the foundation for it. It also comprises someÂ [Application Layer](202206131856.md),
[Transport Layer](202206131837.md) and [Network Layer](202206131702.md)
protocols.

The general structure consists of 4 layers, from low to high:
1. [Link Layer](202206131651.md)#
2. [Internet Layer](202206131702.md)#
3. [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)#
4. [Application Layer](202206131856.md)#

It has the same advantages with [Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md)
as they are both of layered model. However, unlike OSI, it doesn't define which
protocols to used when transmitting data over physical medium.

The following are a list of protocols that are incorporated into TCP/IP:
- HTTP
- [Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md)#
- BOOTP
- [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](202206151645.md)#
- SMTP
- POP
- IMAP
- [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](202210221515.md)#
- TFTP
- [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#
- [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)#
- [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)#
- [Network Address Translation (NAT)](202206281817.md)#
- [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)#
- OSPF
- EIGRP
