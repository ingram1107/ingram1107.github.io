# Cost/Benefit Analysis (CBA)

CBA identifies and quantifies the costs and benefits for a solution and
calculate a measure of merit such as [Net Present Value (NPV)](202305061940.md),
[Return On Investment (ROI)](202305062039.md), or [Payback Period](202305062045.md).
It usually when selecting the best alternative from multiple possible solutions,
that is the solution that achieved the highest merit.

Examples of benefit could be cost reduction, cost displacement (substitutes an
expensive current process with a new lower cost process), cost avoidance,
revenue and performance enhancement (subjective in nature such as quality,
customer satisfaction), and risk reduction.

Examples of sources of cost could be personnel, facilities, and information
technology.

A [total cost of a solution](202305061938.md) including the initial development,
its implementation, and continuing operations.
