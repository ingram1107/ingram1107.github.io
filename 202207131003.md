# Active Image Viewing

Other than [written paper](202207130933.md), images become increasingly important in the digital age. Active accessing the image can be valuable in understanding what's the message the illustrator bring out.

Follow the procedure below:
1. Survey (What's the focal point? Observe the relationship of the foreground and background, left and right and colours used)
2. Inspect
3. Question
 - Designer: Who created this image, why they created it, and who was involved in auditing and editing?
 - Message: What's the subject, how does it being portrayed, what's the purpose of it?
 - Medium: What's the medium, how has it been modified over time, what visual languages has been used?
 - Viewer: Whom are the audience for this image, am I one of them, what's my relationship to the designer, do I agree to the message implied, do I feel comfortable, what's my overall response to it?
 - Context: What's the context of the image first presented, what's the context surrounds it now, does it fit or fight the image?
4. Understand the purpose
