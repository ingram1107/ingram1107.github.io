# Relationship

Relationship is an association among different [Entities](202304191954.md) or
same [Entity Set](202304191956.md). It can have a descriptive properties or
attributes, but in [Entity-Relationship Model (E-R)](202302101334.md), we can't
use it to uniquely identify it.

It is encouraged by Silberschatz et al. [^1] to avoid implicit relationship via
[Attributes](202304200943.md), and instead, embracing explicit relationship by
using [Relationship Set](202304200933.md).
