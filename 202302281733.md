# Lexical Analyser

Lexical analyser is responsible to convert lexemes from an input string into
small-scale language constructs, that is token, such as names and number
literals. Syntactic errors can be detected by the lexical analyser. It also
inserts lexemes for user-defined name into the symbol table for later
compilation phase.

There are several possible implementations of lexical analyser:
- Write a formal description of token patterns in descriptive language related
  to regular expressions which will be used as an input to a software tool such
  as lex to generate a lexical analyser.
- Design a state transition diagram to describe the token patterns of the
  language and write a program to implement it.
- Design a state transition diagram to describe the token patterns of the
  language and hand-construct a table-driven implementation of the diagram.

The reason of separating lexical analyser with [syntax analyser](202302281741.md)
is to simplify the lexical analysis, make syntax analyser smaller and less
complex, be efficient (selective optimisation), and for portability (as lexical
analyser is machine dependent, but syntax analyser is machine independent)
