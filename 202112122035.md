# Hash Table

Hash Table is an array of fixed size that contain keys with no ordering info.

Hash Table could be used in:
- compiler's symbol table
- [202204112045](202204112045.md)
- [transposition table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_table)
- on-line spelling checkers for mispell detection

## Details

- [202112122038](202112122038.md)# is used to map key into the Table.

## Analysis

- Insertions will result in $O(N)$ in average case
- Deletions will result in $O(N)$ in average case
- Finds will result in $O(N)$ in average case
- The table size should be prime to optimise the space usage
