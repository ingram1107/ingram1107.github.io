# 80/20 Rule

80/20 Rule is a networking design based on traffic flow patterns to have 80% of
the traffic contained in a [Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)# whereas the
remaining 20% crosses outside the VLAN networks. The rule has become obsolete as
the network grows. The modern alternative to it is [20/80 Rule](202212251313.md)#.
