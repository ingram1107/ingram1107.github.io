# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort sorts the items by picking the largest currently know element and
move it to the right until it either no longer is the largest or meet the end of
the array.

## Analysis

See [202202220937](202202220937.md)

## Implementation

**Note**: The following algorithm sorts item in ascending order.

```c
void BubbleSort(ElementType A[], int N) {
  for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    for (j = i + 1; j < N; j++)
      if (A[j - 1] > A[j])
        Swap(A[j], A[j - 1]);
}
```
