# Dictatorship of The Proletariat

Dictatorship, in the context of socialist political thought, is the
#[conquest of political power](202204202040.md) and forceable suppression of the
resistance from the exploiters.
[First Congress of the Communist International](lit/@1stCongressOfTheCominternVladimirLenin1919.md)
This is prevalent throughout the history in order for the exploited to retain
the revolution, as could be seen in the English Revolution (the establishment of
the Commonwealth of England) and the French Revolution.

Therefore, following the path of the experience, many socialist figures argue
for the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as opposed to the
status quo (the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie). This means *the conquest of
the political power by the proletariat and forceable suppression of the
resistance from the bourgeoisie*. However, this doesn't mean that the
proletariat should establish literal dictatorship, a form of political
institution. Instead, [Socialist Democracy](202204211120.md)#, a new form of
democracy which adopted to the needs of the proletariat, must be set up.
