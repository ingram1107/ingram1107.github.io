# Pseudoknot

Pseudoknot is a structure formed by [BPs](202310311040.md) between a
[loop](202310311055.md) and a region of the same RNA that is outside the fold
(noncanonical interactions). There are three forms of pseudoknot: H-type, B-type
and Kissing-hairpin. It is considered to be a substructure of the tertiary
structure.

It is responsible for ribosome functioning, RNA splicing, recognition of
tRNA-like structures.

Pseudoknot prediction has high computational complexities (usually $O(n^6)$),
thus the mainstream algorithms only focus on the simplest classes such as
H-type. The prediction assumes that the [RNA Secondary Structure](202310311055.md)
has a local free energy minimum, and uses algorithms to minimise the free energy
in local area, simulating the [RNA Folding](202310311043.md) by adding stems.
