# Data-Manipulation Language (DML)

DML provides ways to retrieve, insert, delete, and modification of the
information in [Database](202302101139.md). It is responsible for database
queries and updates. DML implementation can be *procedural* (define what data to
query and how to do the query) and *declarative* (define only what data to
query, leave the details to deal with query to the database).

It can be embedded into a programming language by using **DML precompiler** where
special character prefaces the actual instructions from DML.
