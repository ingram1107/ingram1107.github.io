# Information Assurance Disciplinary

In drafting and executing the disciplinary process, we have to consider the
impact and actions to be taken, severity of the breaches, relevant legislation,
business contracts etc. All actions should be in accordance with organisation
policy, local laws, and customs.

A typical disciplinary process first obtains evidence prior to initiating an
investigation. Then, we outline a proper investigation process, including roles
and responsibilities, evidence collection procedures, and chain of custody of
evidence. Disciplinary controls are defined which is consistent with legislation
and regulatory requirements. We have to make a list of evidentiary standards to
determine omission and avoid mistreatment. Lastly, we take into consideration
the nature, impact, and significance of the breach.
