# Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)

IGMP is an #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md) protocol used by
hosts and adjacent [Routers](202207061800.md)# to establish multicast
[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)# group memberships which is identified by
[Class D IP addresses](202206280922.md).

When the multicast session begins, the host sends an IGMP message throughout the
network to discover which end stations have joined the group. Then, the host
sends the packet to all multicast group members. At the same time, routers will
observe the IGMP traffic and occasionally send out queries to discover active
and inactive groups in LANs, which later communicate with their neighbour to
establish multicast route for each group.

There is a feature call IGMP snooping in which the [Switch](202207051907.md) can
view the IGMP information (join or leave message) on [Network Layer](202206131702.md),
and forwards the traffic only to the port needed instead of blindly forwards all
multicast traffic. When an IGMP host report is sent through a switch, the switch
adds the host's port number to the associated multicast table entry. If the
leave message is received, the switch removes the host from the table entry.

IGMP functionalities are made obsolete by [ICMPv6](202209270927.md).
