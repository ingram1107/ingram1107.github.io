# Schedulability Analysis

Schedulability analysis focuses on determining whether all tasks can meet their
deadliens based on the deployed [runtime scheduling algorithm](202404232247.md)
while at the same time optimising processor utilisation. It inspects temporal
requirements instead of [Functional Requirement](202303251342.md).
