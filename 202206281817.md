# Network Address Translation (NAT)

NAT is a [IPv4](202206151453.md) technology where public addresses can be
*mapped to* private addresses in the local network. In its translation table, it
includes the port number and the mapped IP address. It usually applied to an
[edge router](202207061800.md) (the most outside router that connected to the
outer world).

It converses IPv4 addresses, increases the flexibility of connections to the
public network, and provides consistency for internal network addressing scheme
and network #security. However, the network #performance and end-to-end
functionality may be degraded. The end-to-end IP traceability is lost, and
tunnelling is more complicated. In addition, initiating TCP connections may be
disrupted.

**Note**: If peer A in a NAT is able to communicate with peer B (not in NAT) via
a third-party peer like peer C that doesn't include into NAT, #p2p
communication can be established between A and B via C.

Due to the need of transitioning to [IPv6](202206281129.md), NAT now function as
a medium to provide transparent communication between IPv6 and IPv4 networks.

In Cisco, we can debug the NAT information with the commands `show ip nat
translations`, `show ip nat statistics`, `clear ip nat statistics`, and `clear
ip nat translations`.

There are two implementations for it:
- [Static NAT](202206281819.md)
- [Dynamic NAT](202206281824.md)
