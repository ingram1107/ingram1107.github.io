# Existential Statement

Existential Statement is a #[202204281244](202204281244.md) which states there is at least one
thing for which the property is true, given that it could be either true or
false. It usually uses *existential quantifier* $\exists$ which express *there is a*, *there exists*, *we can find a*, *there is at least one*, *for some* and *for at least one*.

For example: *There is a prime number that is even* can be denoted in mathematics as $\exists p \in P \text{ such that } p \text{ is a prime number}$ where $P$ represents all positive integers, which read *There exists a $p$ in the set of all positive integers such that $p$ is a prime number*.

To [prove this](202205062050.md), one can just show that at least one $p$ in the set of $P$ is true. To prove that the statement is wrong, one could not avoid proving that all of them are false, which is called the **method of exhaustion**. You can see the difference between it and [202204281245](202204281245.md).

The negation of an Existential Statement is [logically equivalent](202205061231.md)# to a [202204281245](202204281245.md). Formally, this means that $\sim (\exists x \in D \text{ such that } Q(x)) \equiv \forall x \in D, \sim Q(x)$. For instance, the negation of the statement "Some books have a cover" is "All books don't have a cover" or "No books have a cover". As you have noticed, the negation of it is to disprove every element in the set has the property $Q(x)$, which is quite similar to the reasoning of the method of exhaustion.
