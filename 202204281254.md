# Existential Statement

Existential Statement is a #[Mathematical Statement](202204281244.md) which
states there is at least one thing for which the property is true, given that it
could be either true or false. It usually uses *existential quantifier*
$\exists$ which express *there is a*, *there exists*, *we can find a*, *there is
at least one*, *for some* and *for at least one*.

For example: *There is a prime number that is even* can be denoted in
mathematics as $\exists p \in P \text{ such that } p \text{ is a prime number}$
where $P$ represents all positive integers, which read *There exists a $p$ in
the set of all positive integers such that $p$ is a prime number*. We can
symbolise the previous statement further. Assuming $F(p)$ represents the
statement *$p$ is a prime number*, we can rewrite the statement to $\exists p (p
\in P \land F(p))$.

**Note**: Note that Existential Statement always follow by a $\land$ statement.

To [prove this](202205062050.md), one can just [show](202302281138.md) that at
least one $p$ in the set of $P$ is true. To prove that the statement is wrong,
one could not avoid proving that all of them are false, which is called the
**method of exhaustion**. You can see the difference between it and [Universal Statement](202204281245.md).

The negation of an Existential Statement is [logically equivalent](202205061231.md)#
to a [Universal Statement](202204281245.md). Formally, this means that $\sim
(\exists x \in D \text{ such that } Q(x)) \equiv \forall x \in D, \sim Q(x)$.
For instance, the negation of the statement "Some books have a cover" is "All
books don't have a cover" or "No books have a cover". As you have noticed, the
negation of it is to disprove every element in the set has the property $Q(x)$,
which is quite similar to the reasoning of the method of exhaustion.
