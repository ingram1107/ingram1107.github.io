# Python Object Creation

To create an object, define dunder method `__new__` instead of
[__init__](202206081918.md)#. The reason is `__new__` happen earlier than
`__init__`, and it can alter both mutable and immutable object by creating a new
instance of the same class or type compare to `__init__` which can't change the
immutable object. Furthermore, `__new__` allows cheaper object creation by
detecting whether the object has already exists. If it is, there is no need to
create another instance of it, `__new__` will simply return that object. Such
implementation is shown as below:
