# Join Probability Distribution

Join Probability Distribution is defined as below after knowing the
[Conditional Probability](202210261222.md)# $p(y_k|x_j)$ and $p(x_j)$:

$$
p(x_j, y_k) = p(y_k|x_j) p(x_j)
$$

To find $p(y_k, x_j)$, we can just transpose the matrix so that the first row of
$p(x_j, y_k)$ becomes the first column of $p(y_k, x_j)$, the second row becomes
the second column and so on.

We can derive the probability vector of $Y$, $p(Y)$ from addition of each
column in $p(x_j, y_k)$. It'll help in calculating [Conditional Entropy](202210261349.md).
