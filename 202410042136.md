# Rust Fully Qualified Syntax

Since Rust allows same name method in different [Rust Traits](202204061235.md)
implemented in a single type, while the type can also have a method with the
same name, Rust provides a fully qualified syntax to resolve the ambiguity. The
syntax is defined as `<{Type} as {Trait}>::fn(args...)`, which is shown as an
example below:

```rust
<Dog as Animal>::baby_name()
```
