# Ansible Variables

Variables could be defined in #[202204272036](202204272036.md) and #[202204272043](202204272043.md). However,
it is recommended to put variables, primarily credentials that are essential for
connection such as username and password, into Inventory.

**Note**: Variables stored in #[202204300820](202204300820.md) are called *facts*.

To access a variable or fact in Playbook, use the filter syntax or Jinja syntax
``{{ variable }}``. The variable could be stored as YAML file inside directories
named `host_vars` or `group_vars` for the Playbook to access. The variables for
hosts will **take precedence over** variables for groups since they are more
specific.

## Control Flow

For conditionals, we could use the #[202204300820](202204300820.md) `when`. One can use
comparison operators such as `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=`, or `in`
keyword to check whether the value is found in a list. It has some limitation
for potential large amount of tasks. For this, it is advised to use handler or
separate the tasks into a #[202204272036](202204272036.md) and then included later. The usage
is shown as below:

```yaml
...
  tasks:
  - name: Install apache
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest
    when: ansible_distribution == 'Debian' or
          ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
...
```

`register` module could be used in order to store the return status of a task in
order to be used in a later stage. A better approach in control flow could be by
using `handlers`. The following shows the example use case:

```yaml
...
  tasks:
  - name: Ensure httpd package is present
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
    register: httpd_results
  
  - name: Restart httpd
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restart
    when: httpd_results.changed
...
```

Module `notify` is used to notify the handlers when there is a change of state
of the task. Use the module `handlers` to define handler. Its format is quite
similar to #[the tasks](202204272036.md) module. For example:

```yaml
...
  tasks:
  - name: Ensure httpd package is present
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
    notify: restart_httpd
  
  handlers:
  - name: restart_httpd
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: restart
...
```

We could loop over a list of variables or items using the module `loop`. This
could become handy when there is a task should be repeated with multiple
variables. That being said, using `loop` is unfavourable due to the performance
hit. A lot of times, #[202204300820](202204300820.md) has better built-in than `loop`. The
following code shows how to use `loop`:

```yaml
...
  tasks:
  - name: Ensure user is present
    user:
      name: "{{ item }}"
      state: present
    loop:
      - dev_user
      - qa_user
      - prod_user
...
```

**Note**: `item` can store an object, meaning it could be a JSON list instead of
just value.
