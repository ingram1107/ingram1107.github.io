# Soft Timer

Soft [Timer](202404061106.md) is used to schedule non-high-precision software
events. Its [Soft-Timer Handling Facility](202405260026.md) should have
efficient timer maintenance (counting down), installation (starting the timer),
and removal (stopping the timer).

The sole existence of soft timer is to help worker tasks maintain an
application-level, timer countdown table based on timing granularity.
