# Protein Folding

Protein folding is a process that fold the [Amino Acids](202308082207.md) into
3D shape in order to determine its function, which could be done more than one
way. It is folded in order to minimises its free potential energy.

A folded protein is known as the native state. If fail to fold a protein,
it will result in an inactive protein. Misfolded proteins can cause diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Mad Cow disease etc.

Nowadays, there are computer tools that can predict some protein structures in
high accuracy. That being said, the search space is enormous due to minimum
energy as the number of local minima increases exponentially. Currently, there
are two main way on predicting protein folding:
- Comparative protein modelling (homology modelling and protein threading)
- Ab initio protein modelling.
