# Protein Folding

Protein folding is a process that fold multiple [Amino Acids](202308082207.md)
in primary structure, called **polypeptide**, into 3D shape in order to
determine its function, which could be done more than one way driven by
hydrophobic collapse. It is folded in order to minimises its free potential
energy. Each amino acid unit in polypeptide is called a **residue**. The
different ends at the polypeptide chain results in polarity. Due to [Levinthal Paradox](202310291038.md),
folding itself is not random, instead it must have pathways. Its final shape is
determined by variety of bonding interacts between the side chains on the amino
acids. This may cause a number of folds, bends, and loops in the protein chain.

A folded protein is known as the native state. If fail to fold a protein,
it will result in an inactive protein. Misfolded proteins can cause diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Mad Cow disease etc.

Folding may be disrupted by high temperature, extreme pH, or high concentration
of solutes.

Nowadays, there are computer tools that can predict some protein structures in
high accuracy. That being said, the search space is enormous due to minimum
energy as the number of local minima increases exponentially. Currently, there
are two main way on predicting protein folding:
- Comparative protein modelling (homology modelling and protein threading)
- Ab initio protein modelling.
