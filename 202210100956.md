# Galois Field

Galois Field is a finite #[Field](202210082303.md), meaning it contains a finite
number of elements which mathematical operations are defined and satisfy certain
basic rules. We can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
without leaving the field. The total number of elements in Galois Field must be
$p^n$ where $p$ is a prime number. It is denoted as $GF(p^n)$.

Common in [Cryptography](202209281121.md)#, $GF(p)$ is a [Set](202204281446.md)#
where $\{a \in P | a \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } 0 \le a \le p - 1 \}$ with
[modulo](202210090858.md)# prime $p$ as its arithmetic operations. For example,
$GF(7)$ multiplication looks like the table below.

| $\times$ | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ---      | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0        | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1        | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| 2        | 0   | 2   | 4   | 6   | 1   | 3   | 5   |
| 3        | 0   | 3   | 6   | 2   | 5   | 1   | 4   |
| 4        | 0   | 4   | 1   | 5   | 2   | 6   | 3   |
| 5        | 0   | 5   | 3   | 1   | 6   | 4   | 2   |
| 6        | 0   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |

**Note**: Notice the #[multiplicative inverse](202210082303.md) nature of the
Galois Field.

**Note**: The #[inverse](202210082303.md) of the $a$ could be found in the table
by finding the matched row or column with value 1. For example, in the column
$4$, the value 1 appear in the row $2$, thus $2$ is the inverse of $4$ in modulo
7.
