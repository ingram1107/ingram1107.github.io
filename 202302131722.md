# Wide Area File Services (WAFS)

WAFS provides a virtualised file server system operates at [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
that allows high-speed access of remote file service at centralised [Data Centre](202210012205.md)
over [Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md). WAFS done this by utilising file
engine (FE), a dedicated hardware appliance, installed at two
ends: *edge FE* on local and *core FE* on the data centre. Edge FE provides
transparent access to remote file servers as if they are local. It optimises
file service accesses, preserve application performance, and speeding up the
protocol establishment. Furthermore, it also offers file #caching locally on
edge FE which further speed up the performance.
