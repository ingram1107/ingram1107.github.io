# Biological Database

Biological database is a library that stores life sciences information collected
from scientific experiments, published literature, high-throughput experiment
technology, and computational analysis. This includes data from the study of
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microarray [Gene Expression](202308091143.md),
and [Phylogenetics](202308152048.md). Entries in the database had to be
**cross-referenced** and linked to enable fast retrieval. It is quite
challenging to integrate different types of databases that could come in
different formats.

Biological databases could come in web-based or command-line software. Main
web-based databases are **National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI)**, **European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)**, **Ensembl**, and
**University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome bioinformatics site**.
Most command-line software are hosted on Linux environment and can be accessed
via Biopython or manipulated via R. The advantages of using web-based solution
is easy access, rapid updates, good visibility to the community, and ease of
use. In contrast, command-line offers high-throughput solution for large files,
high customisation, high flexibility.

It could be divided into:
- [Primary Biological Database](202308152104.md)
- [Secondary Biological Database](202308152106.md)

Depends on types of the data being stored, it could be classified into:
- [Sequence Database](202308152116.md)
- [Structure Database](202308152117.md)
- [Functional Database](202308152118.md)
