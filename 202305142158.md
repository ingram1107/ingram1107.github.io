# Risk Management

Risk management is the process of identifying, analysing, anticipating, and
monitoring risks in order to minimise their impact on the
[Project](202303251004.md). Risks could be coming from *technology and vendor*
(miscommunication, doesn't meet [Requirement](202303251303.md)), *staff*
(inexperience, single point of failure), *sponsor* (change of management or
overruled by a superior), and *competition*.

There are two approaches to risk management: [reactive](202305142201.md) and
[proactive](202305142202.md). Generally, reducing risk could be done by
following safe #design practices, keeping client informed of possible risks,
making both the client and sponsor understand the solution risk, providing
backup for high risk alternative, using shorter [Payback Period](202305062045.md)
for higher risk alternative, and using judgement to get a ranking of alternative
that combines [Cost/Benefit Analysis (CBA)](202305061903.md) and risk.
