# Modulo Reduction

From #[Modular Arithmetic](202210090858.md), $b$ is a residue of $a \mod n$ as
it could be written in $a = qn + b$. Finding the next in line residue is by
choosing the smallest positive remainder from the equation as residue. Such
process is similar to the following example:

$$
-12 \mod 7 \equiv -5 \mod 7 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \equiv 9 \mod 7
$$

You will notice that from the above example, the next in line residue could be
found by $a - n$ (in this case, $9 - 7$, which become $2$) or $a + n$ ($-12 + 7
= 5$).
