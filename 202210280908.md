# Pipe

Pipe provides a one-way flow of data, where the output of a process is directed
into the input of another, which can be created using `pipe()`
#[Unix System Call](202210062303.md). Pass in a file descriptor array (of type
`int`) with a size of 2, the system call will return 2 file descriptors for use:
`fd[0]` for reading and `fd[1]` for writing. A typical use case of Pipe is to
establish a [communication channel](202210042126.md)# between two related
processes. The maximum amount of data allowed in the pipe (OS treats it like a
[Queue](202112101836.md)#) is usually 5120 bytes. In #unix, Pipe is implemented
using #[Unix Domain Socket](202303232001.md) and shares the information that
resides in the [Kernel](202210062254.md).

**Note**: Since Pipe has no name, only processes that are related (having a
common parent) can create a pipe between them.

**Note**: `socketpair()` allows the creation of full-duplex pipe.

The following source code shows that a parent process initialised a Pipe then
creates a child process which inherits the Pipe from its parent. The parent
closes the read end of the Pipe whereas the child will close the write end of the
Pipe:

```c
int childipd, pipe[2]

if (pipe(pipe1) < 0) < 0) {
  perror("pipe");
  exit(1);
}

if ((childpid = fork()) < 0) {
  perror("fork");
  exit(1);
} else if (childpid > 0 {
  close(pipe[1]); // close write end of the pipe for child

  // Do stuffs...

  close(pipe[0]); // close pipe for child
} else {
  close(pipe[0]); // close read end of the pipe for parent

  // Do stuffs...

  close (pipe[1]); // close pipe for parent
}
```

**Note**: If the queue is empty or is full, the read or write operation will be
blocked respectively until there is information coming in to the pipe.

We can change the pipe's properties via the function `fcntl()` first obtain the
current file status flags before the changing. We could get the flag with the
function with the flag `F_GETFL`, and then add to the flag like `O_NONBLOCK`
with bitwise-OR to the returned flag.

Other than using POSIX interface, we could utilise the support of Pipe by using
the function `popen()` and `pclose` from the standard I/O library (`stdio.h`) in
C which could be used as follows:

```c
FILE *fp;

fp = popen(command, mode);  // create pipe
                            // mode as in "r" or "w", stand as read and write
                            // respectively

pclose(fp);                 // close pipe
```
