# XFS

XFS is one of the #[202202060057](202202060057.md). It is a #[202202061336](202202061336.md)

## Get Information

There are two tools to retrieve the file system's information: `xfs_info` and
`xfs_metadump`. Both of them could be run when the file system is mounted.

`xfs_metadump` could be used in order to store the file system's metadata
offline.

## Tuning

`xfs_admin` allow us to adjust some file system options such as:
- `-j` to enable version 2 [journaling](202202061336.md) format
- `-l` and `-u` to obtain file system label and UUID
- `-L` and `-U` to set file system label and UUID

However, this must be done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent
data corruption.

## Debugging

`xfs_db` allow us to interactively debug the file system. However, this must be
done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent data corruption.
