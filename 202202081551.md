# XFS

XFS is one of the #[linux file system](202202060057.md). It is a #[journaling file system](202202061336.md).

## Get Information

There are two tools to retrieve the file system's information: `xfs_info` and
`xfs_metadump`. Both of them could be run when the file system is mounted.

`xfs_metadump` could be used in order to store the file system's metadata
offline.

## Maintenance

`xfs_repair` repairs the filesystem according the recorded journal. Several
options could be used including `-n` (print only), `-l LOGDEV` (needed if there
is an external log device used), `-r RTDEV` (needed if there is a runtime device
used), `-m N` (maximum memory usage, by default it's 75%), and `-d` (can repair
read-only filesystem). Unfortunately, `xfs_repair` is unable to repair a
filesystem with dirty log. To circumvent this, one could call the options `-L`
to zero out the corrupt log, but this should be used only as the last resort.

## Tuning

`xfs_admin` allow us to adjust some file system options such as:
- `-j` to enable version 2 [journaling](202202061336.md) format
- `-l` and `-u` to obtain file system label and UUID
- `-L` and `-U` to set file system label and UUID

Defragmentation of an XFS filesystem can be done through the command `xfs_fsr`.

However, these commands must be done in an **unmounted file system** in order to
prevent data corruption.

## Debugging

`xfs_db` allow us to interactively debug the file system. However, this must be
done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent data corruption.
