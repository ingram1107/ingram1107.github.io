# Cyclic Code

Cyclic Code is a #[Linear Block Code](202211041839.md) that shows **linear
property** and **cyclic property**. Linear property means that the *sum* of two
code words in a set is also a code word (in the set). Cyclic property means that
*shifting* done on a code word will produce another code word within the set.

We can describe a Cyclic Code of length $n$ with a polynomial of degree $n-1$,
known as [code word polynomial](202212201759.md)#. A [Systematic](202211041836.md)#
Cyclic Code should be in form of:

$$
x(D) = b(D) + D^{n-k}m(D)
$$

Where:
- $x(D)$ is the Cyclic Code polynomial
- $b(D)$ is the [parity polynomial](202212201808.md)#
- $m(D)$ is the message polynomial

**Note**: Notice that last $k$ bits of the resulting $x(D)$ is equal to $m(D)$.
This statement will not hold true for the following non-systematic way of
Cyclic code word generation.

In non-systematic form, the Cyclic Code is defined as:

$$
x(D) = m(D) \times g(D)
$$

Where:
- $g(D)$ is the [Generator Polynomial](202212192305.md)#

Due to the nature of Cyclic Code, we can state that a binary polynomial of order
$n-1$ or less is a code word polynomial [if and only if](202205062055.md) it is
a multiple of [$g(D)$](202212192305.md)#. Multiply a polynomial with $D^i$
[modulus](202210090858.md) with $D^n + 1$ can be viewed as a $i$ right cyclic
shift.
