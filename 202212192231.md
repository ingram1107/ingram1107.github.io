# Cyclic Code

Cyclic Code is a #[Linear Block Code](202211041839.md) that shows **linear
property** and **cyclic property**. Linear property means that the *sum* of two
code words in a set is also a code word (in the set). Cyclic property means that
*shifting* done on a code word will produce another code word within the set.

We can describe a Cyclic Code of length $n$ with a polynomial of degree $n-1$,
known as [code word polynomial](202212201759.md)#. The Cyclic Code should be in
form of:

$$
x(D) = b(D) + D^{n-k}m(D)
$$

Where:
- $x(D)$ is the Cyclic Code polynomial
- $b(D)$ is the [parity polynomial](202212201808.md)#
- $m(D)$ is the message polynomial

**Note**: Notice that last $k$ bits of the resulting $x(D)$ is equal to $m(D)$.

Due to the nature of Cyclic Code, we can state that a binary polynomial of order
$n-1$ or less is a code word polynomial [if and only if](202205062055.md) it is
a multiple of [$g(D)$](202212192305.md)#.
