# Secure Shell (SSH)

SSH is a protocol that aim to establish a secure #[202206151232](202206151232.md) connection between two
computers. It uses the #[202203221212](202203221212.md) in order to secure the network
communication between two hosts. Additionally, one could utilise the
[202203221227](202203221227.md)# feature in order to
[Encapsulation](202210012046.md)# one [Protocol](202209302229.md) (usually
insecure) under SSH thus enhance the security of the protocol.

The keys are encrypted using one of the supported cryptographic algorithms such
as `dsa`, `rsa`, `ecdsa`, `ecdsa-sk`, `ed25519` or `ed25519-sk`. Such keys are
usually stored in the `/etc/ssh` as `ssh_host_rsa_key` and `ssh_host_dsa_key`
alongside with [its configuration](202205191924.md)# files `sshd_config` and
`ssh_config`. You can [202204272031](202204272031.md)# to other computers using the command
`ssh-copy-id`.

Upon key changes, SSH will inform the user about that change before the user
accept the key change anyway. The key change could be tampering so examine such
changes with cautious.
