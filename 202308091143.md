# Gene Expression

Gene expression is a process by which the genetic information flows from
[Genes](202308091142.md) to [RNA](202308082154.md) to proteins. In short, it is
the production of protein from the instructions on the DNA. DNA may only
express some RNA with regulation in some regions in the organism with the
intergenic region.
