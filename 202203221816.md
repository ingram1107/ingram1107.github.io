# Explicit Conversion

In C++, we could restrict the conversion of constructor's argument to use
direct-initialisation instead of copy-initialisation.

The differences between them are shown below:

```cpp
Vector v1{7}; // direct-initialisation
Vector v1 = 7; // copy-initialisation
```

To do this, we could add the specifier `explicit` onto the `Vector` constructor:

```cpp
class Vector {
  public:
    explicit Vector(int s);
}
```

The compiler will recognise that restriction on the conversion is necessary on
the `Vector` and prohibit such conversion during compile time.

```cpp
Vector v1{7}; // OK
Vector v1 = 7; // error in compile time
```
