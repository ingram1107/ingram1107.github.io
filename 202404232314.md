# Rate-Monotonic (RM) algorithm

RM algorithm is the most well-known [Fixed-Priority Scheduling](202404232313.md)
that assigns [Processes'](202210062301.md) priorities based on their period.
Higher priority task will pre-empt the lower one, where the latter will be
placed into a queue of ready tasks.

The process is denoted as $T_1 = (p, f)$ where $p$ is the priority and $f$ is
the frame size.

It is common to be implemented in avionic and other fix-period systems.
