# Critical Path Method (CPM)

CPM is a method of finding out the critical path, the path that requires the
most amount of time, in the [PERT diagram](202305141720.md). If any activity on
the critical path is delayed, the whole project will be delayed. Therefore, as a
project manager, sometimes we have to allocate more resources to the activities
on the critical path in order to avoid project delay.
