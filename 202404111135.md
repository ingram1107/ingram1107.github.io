# Operation Support Subsystem (OSS)

OSS in [Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](202304111937.md) links
[Network Switching System (NSS)](202404111124.md) and [Base Station Controller (BSC)](202303312026.md)
and manages GSM network and [Base Station System (BSS)](202404111123.md)
traffic load. As the number of base stations increases (scaling of customer
population), the maintenance duties will be shifted to [Base Transceiver Station (BTS)](202305162145.md),
lowering the system financial responsibility. In general, OSS is there to
provide network synopsis and assist various services and maintenance
organisations with their runtime maintenance agreements.
