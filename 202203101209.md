# Percolation

Percolation is an algorithmic general strategy to move an element up or down in
the [202112121746](202112121746.md). It is primarily important for #[202202071755](202202071755.md).

When an element is needed to percolate up, it will first create a space in the
deepest level of the tree. Until it found the correct place to settle, it will
keep going up one level in the tree.

When an element is needed to percolate down, it will usually appear in the root
of the tree. Until it found the correct place to settle, it will keep going down
one level in the tree.
