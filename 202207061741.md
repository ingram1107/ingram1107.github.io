# Virtual LAN (VLAN)

VLAN is a logical grouping of devices that breaks the physical boundaries among
them. This means that the devices connected to different
#[Switch](202207051907.md) or in different network can still able to be treated
as a single group.

We can apply access rules and provision services to the users of same or similar
responsibilities without the need to change the topology of the network or
changing the [IP Address](202206281021.md). Furthermore, VLAN can also create
their own [Broadcast Domain](202207061732.md)# without the help from
[Network Device](202206131702.md) [202207051821](202207051821.md) (modern
#[Router](202207051907.md) and #[202207061800](202207061800.md)).

**Note**: Avoid assigning devices into VLAN 1 as it is the default management
interface for all switches which introduces several security risks. Change the
default VLAN to any VLAN other than VLAN 1.

When it comes to deleting a VLAN, the best practice is to move the assigned port
or the VLAN member interface to default VLAN 1 before the deletion. This way,
the interface will still visible to the system after the deletion of VLAN,
otherwise it will be assigned to none of the VLAN, and it is hard to track down
those that are not.
