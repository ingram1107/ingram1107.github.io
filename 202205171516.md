# C Hygiene

1. All local scope variable must be initialised.
2. Use `calloc` instead of `malloc` since the first one automatically
   initialises the variable thus following the Rule 1.
3. Avoid taking local variables addresses using `&` operator as this will
   inhibit [202205171500](202205171500.md)# which is great in [202203011139](202203011139.md)#. See
   [202205171504](202205171504.md).
4. When using pointer as function parameters, use array syntax if you can. The
   following codes shows how to handle four cases: single object that must not
   be null, a known size collection of objects, an unknown size collection of
   objects aka variable length array (VlA), and single object that could be
   null.

```c
// Case 1
int function(int singleObjectMustNotBeNull[static 1]);

// Case 2, the value could be any num that > 1
int function(int fixedSizeCollection[static 7]);

// Case 3
int function(size_t n, int VLA[n]);

// Case 4, impose checking inside the function body
int function(int *singleObjectCanBeNull);
```

5. If possible, avoid using `goto` or jump (`setjump` and `longjump`) instructions in order to have an easily understandable control flow.
