# Cloud Evaluation

Evaluation done among different [cloud providers](202210012158.md) should
involve perspective such as physical property (communication, computation,
memory and cache, storage, and [Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md)),
capacity (transaction speed, [Availability](202210022157.md),
[Latency](202304111955.md), reliability, and [Throughput](202304111957.md)),
cost, elasticity/scalability, [authentication](202210022151.md), and security on
data, [Data Centre Virtualisation](202303081414.md), [network](202209262107.md),
and software.

Some benchmarks can be used for cloud physical property evaluation. For example,
communication can be measured by tools such as `iperf` and `ping`. For
computation, they are HPCC: DGEMM, HPCC: HPL, and LMBench. Memory and cache can
be benchmarked by HPCC, STREAM. The storage can be measured by tools like
Bonnie/Bonnie++, IOR, and NPB: BT/BT-IO. Lastly, the overall performance
measured by BLAST, HPCC: HPL, Montage, NPB suite, and TPC-W.
