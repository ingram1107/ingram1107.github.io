# Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)

SONET, or Sync Digital Hierarchy (SDH) is a [Physical Layer](202206131647.md)
[optical](202404102238.md) technology that supports from 155 Mbps up to 10 Gbps
high transmission rates for [Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)](202209021228.md)
using #[Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)](202209091302.md) multiplexing scheme.
It provides means of transportation to [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)#
protocols and of conversion using Fibre-Optic Transmission Systems (FOTS), which
is a [Modulator](202209291044.md). It has extensive OAMP (*operation*,
*administrative*, *maintenance* and *provisioning*) capabilities. This allows
precise fault detection and a rapid (50 ms) failover (switching to a redundant
or standby computer server, system, hardware component or network upon the
failure or abnormal termination of the previously active application). Its speed
is range from 51.84 Mbps (OC-1) to 9953.28 Mbps (OC-192).

SONET nodes could be connected in the following ways:
- point-to-point
- linear, up to 16 devices total
- Unidirectional Path-Switched Ring (UPSR), where all traffic is homed to a
  central location
- Two-Fibre Bidirectional Line-Switched Ring (2F BLSR), where all traffic is
  local to each set of neighbours, and bandwidth is reusable
- Four-Fibre Bidirectional Line-Switched Ring (4F BLSR), which has the same
  functionality as 2F BLSR but accepts more rings
