# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

ARP is responsible for mapping [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)# to
[Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md)#. See
[Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)](202209301003.md) for the reverse
mapping. Typically, it is used on broadcast networks such as
[Ethernet](202207051550.md)#, Token Ring, and FDDI.
