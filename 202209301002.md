# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

ARP is responsible for mapping [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)# to
[Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md)#. When there is a need for
a host for an IPv4 address, ARP broadcasts a special packet on the Ethernet to
ask for an IPv4 address to respond with its Ethernet address. The mapping is
maintained for future references. See [Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)](202209301003.md)
for the reverse mapping. Typically, it is used on broadcast networks such as
[Ethernet](202207051550.md)#, Token Ring, and FDDI.
