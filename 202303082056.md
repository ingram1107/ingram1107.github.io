# 802.1x

802.1x is an [IEEE](202210010828.md) standard for identity-based networking
service (IBNS) [Protocol](202209302229.md) operates on [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md).
That is, 802.1x is aimed to carry higher-level [authentication](202210040915.md)
information across the links between a client and the authenticator. This means
with 802.1x alone can't validate one's identity, it needs other authentication
services such as [Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md),
TACACS+, [Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs)](202302062041.md), or
[Diameter](202210221333.md) for such service.
