# Pointer to Implementation (PIMPL)

PIMPL, also known as private implementation or Handle-Body, is a way for
encapsulating the implementation from the library interface and further reduce
compilation time especially on the client program. It is done by declaring a
private structure which later the class will point within the class interface,
where the structure will contain the information needed to be stored into the
class. The following shows an example implementation of PIMPL:

```c++
class object_t {
    public:
        object_t(int data) : self_(new int_model_t(data)) {};
        ~object_t() = default;

        // copy constructor
        object_t(const object_t& other) : self_(new int_model_t(*other.self_)) {};

        // assignment operator
        object_t& operator=(object_t rhs)
        {
            object_t tmp(rhs);
            *this = std::move(tmp);
            return *this;
        };

        // move assignment operator
        object_t& operator=(object_t&&) noexcept = default;

    private:
        struct int_model_t;
        std::unique_ptr<int_model_t> self_;
};

struct object_t::int_model_t {
    int_model_t(int data) : data_(data) {};

    int data_;
};
```
