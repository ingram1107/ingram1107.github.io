# Rust Static Variable

Rust provides `static` keyword for one to create a global variable. If such
static variable is of `const`, then its address is expected to be fixed and will
not change during its lifetime.

That being said, it is advised against to use of `static` variable, and instead
opt for [concurrency](202207171541.md) and [Rust Smart Pointers](202111301656.md).
