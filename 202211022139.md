# Signal Handling In POSIX

Handling #[Signals](202211022108.md) could be done in two ways: by **blocking**
and **signal action**. To ease the signal management, we could utilise functions
like `sigfillset()`, `sigemptyset()`, `sigaddset()` and `sigdelset()` from
`signal.h` which their functions are described briefly below.

```c
sigset_t set1;
sigfillset(&set1);  // initialise the signal set; this includes all signals
                    // available on the operatin system

sigdelset(&set1, SIGINT); // remove SIGINT from the signal set
sigaddset(&set1, SIGINT); // add SIGINT to the signal set

sigemptyset(&set1); // remove all signals in the signal set
```

## Blocking

Signal blocking can be useful in protecting the process from being interrupted
while executing a critical task. The signal will be blocked until the
[Process](202210062301.md)# has completed its operations. This could be done
using the function `sigprocmask()` with parameters that specify which action to
take (`SIG_SETMASK`, `SIG_BLOCK`, and `SIG_UNBLOCK`), what signals are involved,
and the returned current mask of blocked signals. A typical usage is shown as
follows:

```c
sigset_t set1;
sigfillset(&set1);  // initialise the signal set

sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &set1, NULL);  // set the current mask of blocked
                                        // signals as set1, which is all signals

sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &set1, NULL);  // unblock signals included in set1
```

## Signal Action

Signal action allows more sophisticated method of Signal Handling. It is defined
through `struct sigaction` and activated via the function `sigaction()`.
`sigaction()` requires 3 parameters to be passed in: the signal that we want to
act on, the `struct sigaction` that is used to handle the signal, and the
returned parameter that specifies the current signal action (usually `NULL`).
The structure for `struct sigaction` and its typical usecase is shown below:

```c
struct sigaction {
  void (*sa_handler) (int); // signal handler, typical values are SIG_DFL
                            // (default action), SIG_IGN (ignore signal) or an
                            // address of a function that take an integer
                            // argument

  sigset_t sa_mask;         // block signal mask during the signal handling
  int sa_flags;             // flag that will affect the signal behaviour
  void (*sa_sigaction)      // pointer to signal handler
};
```

```c
struct sigaction sa;

sa.sa_handler = handler;      // signal will be handled by handler()
sigemptyset(&sa.sa_mask);     // don't block signal while handling signal
sigaction(SIGINT, &sa, NULL); // handler() will be called when encounter SIGINT

void handler(int signo)       // the prototype of a typical signal handler
{
  // ...
}
```

We could further expand its usage by another two signal jump functions from
`setjmp.h` that can affect the [control flow](202205171516.md)# of the program:
`sigsetjmp()` and `siglongjmp()`.
