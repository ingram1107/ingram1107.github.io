# Transport Layer

Transport Layer is the forth layer in #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
It has the same name under #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
Its main purpose is to transfer the chunk of data from [applications](202206131856.md)
to the [network](202206131702.md) transparently (called multiplexing, the
delivery of the packets to applications is called demultiplexing). Sometimes, it
will cut down the sizes of the data and send them as several *packets* (its
#[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)). Their header will identify the
[Well-Known Ports](202206151841.md)# or [socket numbers](202202172152.md) of the
sender and receiver. In this layer, delay and bandwidth are not guaranteed
unless the network layer does.

It provides services such as sequence control, error detection, retransmission,
and [Flow Control](202209302245.md)# so that layer higher than it could assume
error-free transmission.

In OSI particular, [ISO](202209302310.md) 8073 defines 3 types of **network
service types**: A (reliable service, handle all error conditions), B (reliable
service with error and reset notification to transport layer), and C (unreliable
service).

The example of protocols that provide services in this layer are:
- [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#
- [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)#
- [Wide Area File Services (WAFS)](202302131722.md)
- [Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP)](202303021209.md)
- TP0 (type A with no error detection and recovery, and
  [Multiplexing](202209091259.md))
- TP1 (type B with error recovery, and no error detection and multiplexing)
- TP2 (type A with multiplexing and no error detection and recovery)
- TP3 (type B with error recovery, multiplexing and no error detection)
- TP4 (type C with error detection and recovery, and multiplexing, similar to
  TCP)
- [Wireless Transaction Protocol (WTP)](202305171420.md)
- [Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP)](202305171433.md)
