# Transport Layer

Transport Layer is the forth layer in #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
It has the same name under #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
Its main purpose is to transfer the chunk of data from [Application
Layer](202206131856.md) onto the [network](202206131702.md). Sometimes, it will
cut down the sizes of the data and send them as several *packets* (its
#[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)). Their header will identify the
[Well-Known Ports](202206151841.md)# or [socket numbers](202202172152.md) of the
sender and receiver.

It provides services such as sequence control, error detection, retransmission,
and [Flow Control](202209302245.md)# so that layer higher than it could assume
error-free transmission.

The example of protocols that provide services in this layer are:
- [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#
- [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)#
