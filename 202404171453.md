# International Softswitch Consortium (ISC)

ISC is a uniform and comprehensive functional model for [Voice over IP
(VoIP)](202303201850.md) that incorporates all models of IP telephony into a
single framework. It defines a list of functions shown in below:
- Media gateway controller function (MGC-F) maintains state information in
  endpoints and provides call logic and control.
- Call agent function (CA-F) is a subset of MGC-F tha maintains call state.
- Interworking function (IW-F) is a subset of MGC-F that handles signalling
  between heterogeneous networks.
- Routing function and accounting function (R-F/A-F) is a combination of two
  functions where the former handles the routing of calls for the MGC-F while
  the latter collects information for #accounting purposes.
- Signalling gateway function (SG-F) handles signalling between an
  [IP](202206151223.md) network and the PSTN.
- Access gateway signalling function (AGS-F) handles the signalling between an
  IP network and a [circuit-switched](202207150846.md) access network.
- Application server function (AS-F) handles a set of application services
- Service control function (SC-F) handles the calls from AS-F to grant it
  control on the service logic.
- Media gateway function (MG-F) handles the translation of digitised audio
  between two forms.
- Media server function (MS-F) manipulates a media packet stream on behalf of an
  AS-F application.
