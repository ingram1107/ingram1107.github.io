# Usability Principles

Usability principles are similar to [Design Principles](202304081725.md). It is
mainly used as the basis for evaluating systems and provides a framework for
heuristic evaluation (examining the interface and judging its compliance to the
principles). It can be aided by [Learnability Principles](202305142214.md),
[Flexibility Principles](202305142216.md), and [Robustness Principles](202305142217.md).

According to Nielsen 2001, the principles consist of:
- visibility of system status
- match between system and the real world
- user control and freedom
- consistency and standards
- help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
- error prevention
- recognition rather than recall
- flexibility and efficiency of use
- aesthetic and minimalist design
- help and documentation
