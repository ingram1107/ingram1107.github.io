# XPath

XPath is a means to search a specific [Extensible Markup Language (XML)](202305281742.md)
elements in a document. It is part of the [Extensible Sytlesheet Language (XSL)](202311211640.md)
specifications. Each element, attribute, comment, etc is treated as a node (in
addition with the root node, `/`) in a [Tree](202112101956.md). Attribute nodes
can be selected with the `@` symbol.

We can state an absolute path and relative path in XPath for the navigation. It
is quite similar to what the Linux path works except for the relative path which
started with `//`. Like in #programming-language, we can access a specific
matching child by indexing with the syntax of `[{number}]`. For example, to get
the first matching child, we can write `/root/element/target[1]`. `*` indicates
that all element at this level, and will try to catch every instances that match
the pattern.

XPath also includes some path functions like `node()` (return node value),
`text()`, `comment()`, `last()`, and `position()` for more refine control on the
information that we should get. Comparative operators like `<`, `=`, `>`, and
`not()` can be useful in aiding finding the matches.
