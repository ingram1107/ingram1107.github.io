# White Box Testing

White box testing is a [test case design method](202206201159.md) that uses the
control structure of the procedural design to derive test cases, thus needing
the access to the internal data structures of the product. Independent paths
within a module (control structure), logical decisions (branching), loops, and
internal data structures could become the test cases.

**Note**: Follow the suggestion from [Unit Testing](202206201320.md) of not
testing many things in a single test case.

There are two approaches for white box testing:
- [Basis Path Testing](202305211025.md)
- [Control Structure Testing](202305211134.md)
