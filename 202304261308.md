# Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)

LDP is a [Label Distribution](202304261259.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md),
defined by [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md), operates
at [Application Layer](202206131856.md) where the label is mapping information
to [Label Switching Routers (LSRs)](202305032302.md). It maps [Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FEC)](202209282123.md)
to labels which in turn create [Label-Switched Paths (LSPs)](202305032308.md).
It acts as an explicit signalling and management extension to [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md).
LDP sessions are established between LDP peers in MPLS network without
necessarily being adjacent to each other. Routing protocols such as
[OSPF](202211101623.md) or [BGP](202210242013.md) may be employed at the same
time with LDP. There are extensions of it to support explicit
[routing](202207061815.md) based on the [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)
requirements.

Generally, LDP has four message types: **discovery message**, **session
message**, **advertisement message**, and **notification message**. Discovery
message is responsible for announcing and maintaining the presence of an LSR in
network. Session message on the other hand have to establish, maintain, and
terminate the sessions between LDP peers. Advertisement message is sent to
create, change, and delete label mappings for FECs. Notification message
provides advisory information and signal error information.
