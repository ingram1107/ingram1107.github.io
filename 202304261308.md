# Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)

LDP is a [Label Distribution](202304261259.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md)
defined by [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md) to act as
an explicit signalling and management extension to [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md).
There are extensions of it to support explicit [routing](202207061815.md) based
on the [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) requirements.
