# Replacement Selection

Replacement Selection unlike other #[202203102010](202203102010.md), is aimed to produce
optimised runs instead of handling the sorting entirely.

It needs at least two structures: a [202202062259](202202062259.md) which is used to compare
the items in the tape or drive and an array which is used to store any items
that is smaller than the latest inserted item.

First, we will build a heap by using the first $M$ items in the input tape or
drive. After that, we will write the smallest item in the heap to the output
tape or drive where later it will be deleted from the heap, and then compare it
to the current first item in the input tape or drive to determine whether it is
larger than the latest inserted item. If it is indeed larger, it will be added
into the heap. Otherwise, it will go to the array. The steps will be done
[recursively](202202151731.md) until either it hit the end of the tape or the
array becomes full.

When the array becomes full, the items of the array will be used to construct a
new heap. Repeat the steps above until there is no items left in the input tape.

This algorithm is best when combined with one of the #[202203102010](202203102010.md) to
achieve greater performance compare to naive merges.
