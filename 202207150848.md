# Packet Switching

In packet switching, resources are not reserved unlike in [Circuit Switching](202207150846.md).
Therefore, the end system have to wait for access to communication link. It
involves statistical [Multiplexing](202209091259.md)# of packets. However, there
is no strict rule on which path should the packet flow. The packet switchers,
[Router](202207061800.md) or [Switch](202207051907.md), form the backbone of a
packet switched network. The transmission rate of such network is equal to the
full transmission rate of a link, thus doesn't have the same issue as in
[Circuit Switching](202207150846.md) and at the same time allowing for
potentially more simultaneous connections.

Most packet switchers use store-and-forward transmission at the inputs of the
links, that is switch must receive the entire packet before transmission which
add to the delay. This is called [Transmission Delay](202302161914.md).
Furthermore, there is another delay called [Queuing Delay](202302161904.md) due
to the nature of packet switching needing output buffer for each link that
stores packets that are about to be sent. The packet is loss if the queue is
full and is dropped by the packet switcher. The total delay is shown as a
formula in below:

$$
\text{total delay } = \text{ total number of links } \times \text{ delay}
$$

Packets could share the same circuit, therefore adding redundancy, that is
adding more circuits into it to increase [Network Reliability](202210012123.md)#
could also increase its overall throughput.

Packet switched networks can be categorised into two kinds:
- [Datagram Network](202302161652.md)
- [Virtual-Circuit Network](202302161655.md)

The following shows variety examples of [Packet Switching](202207150848.md):
- [Frame Relay](202208291308.md)#
- [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md)#
- Broadband DSL
- Metro Ethernet
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)#
