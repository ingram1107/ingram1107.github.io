# Packet Switching

Similar to [202207150846](202207150846.md). Involves statistical
[Multiplexing](202209091259.md)# of packets. However, there is no strict rule on
which path should the packet flow.

Packets could share the same circuit, therefore adding redundancy, that is
adding more circuits into it to increase [Network Reliability](202210012123.md)#
could also increase its overall throughput.

- [Frame Relay](202208291308.md)#
- [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md)#
- Broadband DSL
- Metro Ethernet
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)#
