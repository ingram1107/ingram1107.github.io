# Multithreading Management

Multithreading becomes important as the number of core for the processor
increases. This allows the possibility of [parallelism and concurrency](202202011649.md)#
along with their [limitation](202202011808.md)# and
[shortcomings](202202011815.md)# with the utilisation of
[threads](202112061044.md)#. [Producer-consumer problem](202201301240.md)# is
one of the thinking model hinting on a better parallel and/or concurrency
programming.

There are many language facilities and libraries that ease such management for
the programmer.

## Pthread

Note that most of the Pthread functions doesn't set the `errno` value in the
function body, but instead return the value of the `errno` once it encounters
any error during the process. Therefore, it is important to utilise such
characteristics to set the `errno` value after getting the return value of a
Pthread function.
