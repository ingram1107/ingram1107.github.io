# C++ Concepts

C++(20) Concepts control the instantiation of the templates by testing syntactic
conditions in order to constrain the templates in which the type have to meet
the requirements specified. They have superseded the functionalities from
#[Traits](202204181611.md), #[Compile Time Type Determination](202204181536.md)
and #[Template Deduction Guide](202204182011.md). It could be defined as follows
using `concept` keyword:

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Equality_comparable = requires(T a, T b) {
  { a == b } -> bool; // compare Ts with == which return boolean
  { a != b } -> bool; // compare Ts with != which return boolean
}
```

It could be used to restrict the type which must matched the defined
characteristics. Sort of like [Rust Trait](202204061235.md). We could use it in
a template like below:

```cpp
template<Equality_comparable T>
bool is_zero(T a) {
  return a == 0;
}
```

If we use it directly, `concept` will always return boolean. For example:

```cpp
static_assert(Equality_comparable<int>); // true

struct S { int s; };
static_assert(Equality_comparable<S>); // false
```
