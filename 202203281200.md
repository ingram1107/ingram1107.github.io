# C++ Concepts

C++(20) Concepts has superseded the functionalities from #[202204181611](202204181611.md),
#[202204181536](202204181536.md) and #[202204182011](202204182011.md). It could be defined as follows using
`concept` keyword:

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept Equality_comparable = requires(T a, T b) {
  { a == b } -> bool; // compare Ts with == which return boolean
  { a != b } -> bool; // compare Ts with != which return boolean
}
```

It could be used to restrict the type which must matched the defined
characteristics. Sort of like [202204061235](202204061235.md). We could use it in a template
like below:

```cpp
template<Equality_comparable T>
bool is_zero(T a) {
  return a == 0;
}
```

If we use it directly, `concept` will always return boolean. For example:

```cpp
static_assert(Equality_comparable<int>); // true

struct S { int s; };
static_assert(Equality_comparable<S>); // false
```
