# Label Switching Router (LSR)

LSR is a core [Router](202207061800.md) in an [MPLS](202207150852.md) network
that often is high speed.

**Note**: [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md) switches (in fact
they are routers) can be used as LSRs without the change of the hardware as the
label switching is the same to the [VP/VC switching](202302161655.md).
