# Real-Time System (RTS)

RTS is a system that is subjected to **performance constraints** in which late
or incorrect response will result in **hazardous consequences**. Such system
must respond to, monitor, control, interact with incoming information in a
timely manner. Being fast is not the point, though, a good real-time system
should be *just fast enough* to satisfy all [Functional Requirements](202303251342.md),
constraints, and timing requirements (*absolute* where response with deadlines
and *relative* where response within a specified period of time).

A typical RTS includes the system itself, the environment, and the interface.
Those interfaces may consist of input (sensors), output (actuators), and/or
bidirectional flow of information (communication channels). Software may be used
to control RTS so that the development costs become significantly lower, easier
to verified and maintain. Unit cost will be higher, however, since a
microcontroller is required and an appropriate power source, but it generally
worth the cost. RTS program may access resources by directly through machine
instructions or indirectly through an intermediate operating system.

Based on the importance of timing requirement or the trigger condition, we can
classify RTS into following types:
- [Hard Real-Time System](202403301928.md)
- [Soft Real-Time System](202403301930.md)
- [Clock-Based Real-Time System](202403301942.md)
- [Event-Based Real-Time System](202403301959.md)
- [Interactive Real-Time System](202403302005.md)

The operating system of RTS should offer an optimal platform for multitasking
and resource sharing, make designing application #software easier (less hardware
bound), and makes engineers or programmers to fully concentrate on their core
product knowledge instead of learning computer-specific issues. The
software-level functions that a RTOS must provide is **task scheduling**, **task
dispatching**, and **[Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md)**.
