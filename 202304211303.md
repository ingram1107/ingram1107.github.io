# Network Topology

Network topology could be referred to a [physical](202210012110.md) or
[logical](202210012112.md) view of the network.

The following shows the possible network topology one would adopt:
- [Hierarchical Network](202304211308.md)
- [Bus Network](202304211310.md)
- [Ring Network](202304211314.md)
- [Star Network](202304211316.md)
- [Mesh Network](202304211344.md)
- [Basic Service Set (BSS)](202304171335.md)
- [Extended Service Set (ESS)](202304171342.md)

**Note**: [WLAN Roaming](202303021542.md) is important in wireless network
topologies to provide a seamless transmission from one AP to another AP.
