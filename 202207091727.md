# "It Can't Happen"

In engineering or other fields, the mentality "it can't happen" could do harms
to the project. This becomes prevalent in the software engineering and IT
profession as well.

If, for example, you have stumbling across the application codebase, run it, and
found something that surprise you, reevaluate your assumptions, be willing to
[debug it](202203131236.md)#. Don't just "know" your code works, prove it, in
this context, with this data, with these boundary conditions. Add new
[test](202206201159.md)# to it, [Crash Program Earlier](202207091736.md)# or put
some [Assertions](202207091744.md)#. You can go further by adopting
[Defensive Programming](202207072153.md)#, enforcing checks on precondition,
postcondition and class invariant by [Design by Contract (DBC)](202206301938.md)#.
