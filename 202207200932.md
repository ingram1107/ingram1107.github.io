# Universal Conditional Statement

Some [202204281244](202204281244.md) can express both property of #[202204281245](202204281245.md) and #[202205062055](202205062055.md) which make it a #[202205061208](202205061208.md), named Universal Conditional Statement.

For example: For all computers, if it is a laptop, then it has operating system
on it. This statement has first the *universal property* (for all), then the *conditional
property* (if-then). It is a Universal Conditional Statement. The statement could be
further transformed which means the same thing, shown as follows:
- For all computer $c$, if $c$ is a laptop, then $c$ has operating system on it.
- For all laptop $c$, $c$ has operating system on it. (explicit universal)
- If $c$ is a laptop, then $c$ has an operating system on it. (explicit
  conditional)

The negation of it is expressed formally as $\sim (\forall x, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)) \equiv \exists x \text{ such that } P(x) \land \sim Q(x)$. Consider the statement "For all computer programs, if it is in Java programming language, then it at least has 5 lines". Transform to its negated form, that is an [202204281254](202204281254.md) that consists of an and statement which could be referred to the section of Conditional Statement in [202205061240](202205061240.md)#, which is "There exists at least one computer program that it is in Java programming language, and it has less than 5 lines".
