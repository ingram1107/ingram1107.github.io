# Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)

WiMAX is a high-speed broadband wireless access (BWA) technique to operates in
[Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)](202209021228.md). It has great
interoperability between different vendor's products as it is also act as a
certification mark for products that pass the conformity and interoperability
tests for the IEEE 802.16 standards. It may achieve a speed up to 75 Mbps over
30 miles or 48 km radius. Thus, it is fast enough to support more than 60
business entities with T1-level connections and hundreds of homes with
[DSL](202208312036.md)-rate connectivity using 20 MHz channel bandwidth.

However, WiMAX seems to be obsolete as the latest update to IEEE 802.16 stop at
2017, and most services in #malaysia are retired after 2019.
