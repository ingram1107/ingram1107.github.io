# Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)

WiMAX is a high-speed broadband wireless access (BWA) technique to operates in
[Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)](202209021228.md). It has great
interoperability between different vendor's products as it is also acted as a
certification mark for products that pass the conformity and interoperability
tests for the [IEEE 802.16](202305282152.md) standards. It may achieve a speed
up to 75 Mbps over 30 miles or 48 km radius. Thus, it is fast enough to support
more than 60 business entities with T1-level connections and hundreds of homes
with [DSL](202208312036.md)-rate connectivity using 20 MHz channel bandwidth.

WiMAX provides two forms of wireless services, i.e., **non-line-of-sight
(NLOS)** service and **line-of-sight (LOS)** service. NLOS provides
[Wi-Fi](202303292155.md) like service that utilises the network card on the
mobile unit and uses lower frequency range from 2 GHz to 11 GHz. It is not as
easily disrupted by physical obstructions. LOS, on the other had, requires fixed
dish antenna that points directly at the WiMAX tower and uses higher frequencies
from 10 GHz to 66 GHz, thus its connection is stronger and more stable. There is
less interference and more bandwidth because of its high frequencies.

However, WiMAX seems to be obsolete as the latest update to [IEEE 802.16](202305282152.md)
stop at 2017, and most services in #malaysia are retired after 2019.
