# Graph

Graph consists of set of **vertices**, $V$ and set of **edges**, $E$ as in $G = (V,E)$.
Each edge consists of a pair of vertices, such in $(v, w)$ where both
$v$ and $w$ are in the set of $V$, thus $v,w \in V$.

There are two kinds of graph:
- [202204112118](202204112118.md)#
- [202204112129](202204112129.md)#

## Terminology

A *path* is a sequence of vertices where $(w_i, w_{i+1}) \in E$. Its length
could be determined by the number of vertices that it contains. A 0-length path
indicates that there is no vertex in the path.

A *simple path* is a path that all vertices are distinct except for the first
and the last vertex.

A *cycle* is a path where the first and the last vertex are the same required
that the path must be at least of length 1. If the path is simple, then the
cycle is simple.

A Graph is *complete* if there is an edge between every vertex.

## Representation

A graph could be represented in two ways: adjacency matrix representation and
adjacency [202110191710](202110191710.md) representation.

**Adjacency matrix representation** basically is a 2D array. If there is an edge
between $u$ and $v$, set $A[u][v]$ as 1 or the corresponding weight if the edge
could be measured in weight. Set it to 0 or any value that indicate that the
edge is non-existent. This will result in $\Theta(\vert V \vert^2)$ space
complexity.

**Adjacency list representation** keeps a list of adjacent vertices (put it null
if there is none) for each vertex. This will result in $O(\vert E \vert + \vert
V \vert)$ space complexity.

## Name Lookup

Sometimes vertices could have their own names which is not ideal to be used for
indexing. We could use [202112122035](202112122035.md) to assign those names to an associated
number.

For output convenience, we could either store those names in an array of string
according to their indexing number or use an array of pointers that point to the
cell of hash table. The first method could cost more spaces, the second method
makes the hash table's cells too accessible since it bypasses the basic hash table
operations.
