# Information Assurance on Termination or Change of Employment

Examples of information assurance actions taken upon termination or change of
employment are temporary or permanent closing of accounts, steps for forwarding
e-mails, change of critical passwords and phone numbers, and disabling access to
all systems.

For termination, the employee must return all company assets and items of the
identification and format working computer following specific instruction. Any
logs of activity and access for the terminated employee will be archived for 90
days minimum. The employee have to know their ongoing security requirements and
legal responsibilities within any confidentiality agreement, employee contract,
or rules of behaviour, their terms and conditions of employment, and the
effective period of those terms, conditions, and agreements.
