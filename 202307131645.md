# Kernel-Persistent IPC

Kernel-persistent [IPC](202210262136.md) is a kind of IPC where the created
objects exist within the lifetime of the [Kernel](202210062254.md), that is
until it is rebooted, or until it is explicitly deleted. Examples of this type
of IPC are System V's [Message Queue](202212071258.md),
[Semaphore](202212071928.md), and [Shared Memory](202302251019.md), and their
[POSIX](202307131648.md) counterparts.
