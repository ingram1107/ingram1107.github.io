# AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)

It is possible for us to build our own [Docker](202110201636.md) containers
among [EC2](202401152149.md) instances, AWS ECS offers a much simpler, highly
scalable, high-performance [Container Orchestration](202203291434.md) service.
It features container deployment monitoring, cluster's state management, and
scheduler. AWS ECS also integrates well with other AWS services such as Elastic
Load Balancing, security groups, [EBS](202401182023.md) volumes, and [IAM roles](202312131707.md).

The preparation of running application on ECS is started from the creation of
task definition which describes one or more containers, up to a maximum of ten.
It specifies the parameters for the application, such as which containers to
use, which ports to be opened, and what data volumes should be used. The AWS ECS
task scheduler will then place the task within an ECS cluster accordingly, in
which an Amazon ECS container agent is running on it.
