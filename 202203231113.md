# Lambda Expression

In C++, we could specify how and what we want to capture from the scope outside
the lambda scope in lambda expression. A typical lambda expression will be like
follow:

```cpp
[](const string& a){return a < s;};
```

There are three level of capture level for lambda expression: `[]` specify to
capture nothing, `[&]` specify to capture all variable inside the expression by
reference and `[=]` specify to capture all variable inside the expression by
value.

We could also indicate that what variable should we capture only with the syntax
`[&x]` or something similar.
