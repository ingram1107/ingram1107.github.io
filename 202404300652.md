# Deficit Round Robin Algorithm

Deficit round robin algorithm is one of the [Traffic Shaping](202302201414.md)
technique that can be deployed in [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md).
Instead of counting the packet transferred, bytes sent is accounted, and
temporary deficit is allowed in the case of large packet.
