# Internal Sorting

Internal Sorting is a type of sorting algorithm that done their sorting within
the capacity of the main memory. Although it could be quite fast since the
operation is done in the RAM speed, internal sorting has a limitation on
handling files that store in physical drive due to the inefficiency of I/O
access. See [202203102010](202203102010.md) for that regard.

There are several algorithms that are optimal for internal sorting:
