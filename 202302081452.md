# Floating Point Bits Representation

Referring to [IEEE 754](202302081844.md) standard, a floating point value should
be represented using 32 bits where:
- the first bit represents the sign, where 0 represent positive and 1 represent
  negative,
- the consequent 8 bits represent the exponent (from -127 to 128),
- the last 23 bits represent the Mantissa where the most significant bit value
  is strip off to be added later.

**Note**: It is fairly similar to scientific notation such as $3.23 \times
10^{12}$. And since the most significant bit of Mantissa portion from the
floating point value will always be 1 following this method, it can be ignored
in practice.

Note that when converting conventional decimal value to floating point bits
representation, the exponent bit value to represent such floating point can be
calculated using the following formula:

$$
\text{exponent bit value} = \text{exponent} + 127
$$

To convert IEEE 754 floating point value to conventional decimal point, the
following formulae can be a great help:

$$
N = (1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}}) \times 2^{E - 127}
$$

Where:
- $N$ represents the conventional decimal point
- $M$ is the value of Mantissa
- $E$ is the exponent bit value

## Additional

In approximation mathematics, $\log (1 + x) \approx x$ when $0 < x < 0.1$. From
here, we can assume that the bit presentation of the floating point value is
equal to doing logarithm on itself. To decrease the error, we can add a constant
$\mu$ to adjust the $x$ so that it become $\log (1 + x) \approx x$. From
experience, $\mu = 0.430$ seems to have the smallest error on average. Applying
the above formulae, we can conclude:

$$
\begin{align}
N &= (1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}}) \times 2^{E - 127}\\
&\approx \log (1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}} \times 2^{E - 127})\\
&\approx \log (1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}}) + \log(2^{E - 127})\\
&\approx \log (1 + \frac{M}{2^{23}}) + E - 127\\
&\approx \frac{M}{2^{23}} + \mu + E - 127\\
&\approx \frac{M}{2^{23}} + \frac{2^{23}E}{2^{23}} + \mu - 127\\
&\approx \frac{1}{2^{23}} (M + 2^{23}E) + \mu - 127
\end{align}
$$
