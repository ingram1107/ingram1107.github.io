# Access Control

Access Control is the ability to manage (limit and control) the access to host
systems and applications via communication links. With Access Control, one could
specify one has the access to a particular resource, under which condition
should the access be permitted, and what those with access are permitted to do.

It could be used as a counter of [Masquerade](202209262114.md)# so that none of
the unauthorised source could access resources without permission.
