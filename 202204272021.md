# Ansible

Ansible is an [open source](202110161031.md) automation tool for system
administration especially in [Linux](202204081225.md). It could be used
for system monitoring, #[Infrastructure Configuration Management](202205041217.md),
disaster recovery, system maintenance, policy enforcement etc. It is one of the
widely adopted #[IaC](202206061419.md) tool.

To use Ansible, we need to install it into a node, which will become the
*management node* or *control node* where we will place our configuration files
or [Ansible Playbooks](202204272036.md)# in here. Ansible will then run on
remote hosts called *managed nodes* using the playbooks without actually
installed into them. By default, it uses [Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md)
as the mean of communication between management node and managed nodes. We could
configure it in [Ansible Basic Configuration](202204302318.md)# to use SFTP or
SCP instead. The SSH public key needs to be [transferred](202204272031.md) to
the managed nodes.

For network devices and API endpoints, Ansible will run the module codes locally
in the control node taking advantages of parallelism. To increase scalability,
one could install [Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform](202204292323.md)# as a
[cluster](202304251207.md). For Linux or Windows hosts, it will run the module
codes remotely in the managed nodes since these machines have facility to
execute commands by themselves. The module codes are copied to those remote
machines and executed there. These remote hosts will then send back the result
of the module codes in JSON format.

Ansible also stores a list of nodes where the playbooks ran against that is
managed by itself with [Ansible Inventory](202204272043.md)#.

It contains command-line interface (CLI) which includes `ansible`,
`ansible-playbook` and `ansible-doc`, the language for configuration such as
YAML, framework for plugins and functions for control flows. There are several
[Means to Get Ansible Collections](202205051149.md)# into the management node,
one example is by using `ansible-galaxy` CLI tool.
