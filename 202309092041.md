# Protein Secondary Structure

There are several types of [protein](202308082207.md) secondary structure such
as $\alpha$ helix, $\beta$ sheet or strand, $\beta$ turn, and $\Omega$ loop. It
can be described by the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the peptide backbone of the
protein. In other words, secondary structure is formed by regular pattern of
hydrogen bonds between peptide N-H and C=O groups of amino acids that near each
one another in linear sequence.

Different amino acids have their own preferences on which secondary structure to
form. Alanine, glutamate, and leucine tends to form $\alpha$ helix. For $\beta$
sheet, they are valine and isoleucine. Glycine, asparagine, and proline on the
other hand favours $\beta$ turn.

**Note**: Glycine and proline can disrupt the regularity of an $\alpha$ helical
backbone conformation, thus are named "helix breakers".

Prediction on secondary structure is favoured since it is better conserved than
its primary counterpart. To predict protein secondary structure, the method has
to base only on amino acid sequences. Methods so far developed are:
- [Chou-Fasman Method](202309092050.md)
- [Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson (GOR) method](202309092100.md)
- [MultiLayer Percepton ANN](202309091359.md) such as [Profile Network (PHD)](202309092111.md)
