# Feed-Forward ANN Connection

A feed-forward [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](202309091335.md) does not have
a [directed cycle](202204112118.md), and the information will only move forward.

Types of feed-forward ANN connection are:
- [Single Layer Perceptron](202309091416.md)
- Multilayer Perceptron (has one or more hidden layers)
- Radial Basis Functions
