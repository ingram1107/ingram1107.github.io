# Design by Contract (DBC)

DBC is a software engineering practice typically used in #[202202041514](202202041514.md) and #[202207072153](202207072153.md) that treat module design as designing a contract. The contract consists of three major conditions: **precondition**, **postcondition** and **class invariant**.

*Precondition(s)* is what must be true in order for the routine to be called. This can be translated to the *routine's requirements*. For example: What should be the type of the parameter(s)? What value of the parameter(s) is expected to be passed in? The precondition(s) of a routine should be checked by the *caller*, that it is the responsibility of the caller to pass valid data to the routine. If such requirement can't be satisfied, then the routine shall never be called.

*Postcondition(s)* is what the routine is guaranteed to do. It is usually about verifying the *return state of the routine*. For example: What should be the type of value returned by the routine? Could the return value smaller than the said value? This should be checked by the *routine* itself. However, the checking of the postcondition can be varying due to the language implementation as it relies on the parameters passed into the method. If the routine allows the change of such parameter, the contract can be circumvented, which violates the DBC principle.

*Class invariant* is a condition that remained *unchanged* to constrain the objects of the class. It must always be true *before* and *after* the call of the method. The class invariant can be violated in between the call, though.

There are other invariants that could further enhance the design of the codebase. *Loop invariants* can be used to make sure that the condition or state of a variable or an object is true before entering the loop and on each loop iteration. *Semantic invariants* are more like a *philosophical contract*. It applies inviolate requirements which express the *meaning* of a thing instead of restricting which policy should be employed.

**Note**: The *old value* of a parameter is important on forming the contract.

If any of these violated during the compile time or runtime, the building of the program should fail or the program simply [crashed](202207091736.md). The alternative to this is to raise an #exception when such violations are encountered. Then, the programmer will handle them in care and crash the program gracefully if possible.

With DCB, the program will do no more and no less than it claims to do. The contract should be put on the base class, and to be enforced to all its deriving classes. The new subclass must support the same method, and that method retains its meaning without much alteration (*invariant* must be preserved stated by #[](202202041514.md#Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle%20LSP)). It can, however, accept a wider range of input (*precondition* can be weakened) or make a stronger guarantee (*postcondition can be strengthened*) than its parent.

The programmer should be strict about what should they *accept before the beginning* of the function or method implementation, and *promise as little as possible* in return. Such mindset will help to construct a good contract for the function or method to follow. Additionally, contracts must be designed before committing to code implementation, just like setting up the [test facilities](202206201159.md).

Example of implementation of DBC are:
- Eiffel (a programming language focus on DBC) [^eiffel]
- GNU Sather (a programming langauge focus on DBC) [^sather]
- Nana (library for #c and #cpp) [^nana-github]
- iContract (library for #java)
- Cofoja (modern library for #java) [^cofoja-github]
