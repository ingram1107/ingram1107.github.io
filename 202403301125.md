# PowerPC Address Layers

PPC address layers consists of virtual, effective, and physical addresses.
32-bit virtual address is mapped to 54-bit effective address, which is then
mapped to 36-bit physical address, which is then pass to system controller.

entry lookup. Therefore, it doesn't need to check duplicate copies among
processors.
