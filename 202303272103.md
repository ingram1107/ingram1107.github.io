# Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC)

HFC combines [Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md) and [Coaxial Cable](202302161846.md)
to provide high-speed [Data Communication](202303271923.md) where the fibre is
used for central facilities (require highest bandwidth) and coaxial cables for
connections to individual Internet subscribers (lower bandwidth). Thus, we can
say that HFC is hierarchical.
