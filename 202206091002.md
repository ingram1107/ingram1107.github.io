# Test Harness

Test Harness is a collection of software and test data configured to test a
program unit by running it under varying conditions and monitoring its behaviour
and outputs. [^wikipedia2022] It allows #[test facility](202206201159.md)
#automation.

A viable Test Harness consists of several functionalities:
[@Hunt1999](lit/@Hunt1999.md)
- a standard way of set-up and clean-up
- a method for selecting individual test or all available tests
- a means of analysing output for expected or unexpected results
- a standardised form of failure reporting (via logging)

Examples of test harness are:
- xUnit.net (for .Net platform) [^xunit]
- Visual Studio Unit Testing Framework [^mstest]
- NUnit (for .Net platform) [^nunit]
- Google Test (#cpp) [^gtest]
- JUnit (#java) [^junit]
- Pytest (#python) [^pytest]
- SUnit (Smalltalk) [^sunit]

**Note**: When professional mentions xUnit, they are usually referring to the
xUnit interface, not the one that provide unit testing framework for .Net
platform. xUnit consists of a collection of uniting testing frameworks which
derived from the SUnit interface.
