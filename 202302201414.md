# Traffic Shaping

Traffic Shaping is a [congestion technique](202304261436.md) to deal with
instantaneous or sustained bursts of traffic above a desired rate by delaying
part of the traffic burst until the traffic rate falls below the line rate
(called throttling). It controls the rate at which packets are sent before they
enter the network. Upon connection set-up time, the sender and the intermediate
nodes will negotiate a traffic pattern using the following algorithms:
- [Leaky Bucket Algorithm](202305171656.md)
- [Token Bucket Algorithm](202305171706.md)
- [Weighted Round Robin Algorithm](202404300650.md)
- [Deficit Round Robin Algorithm](202404300652.md)

It is used in [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md) and
Integrated Services networks.
