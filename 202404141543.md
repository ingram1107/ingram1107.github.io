# Context Switching

Context switching is a process of saving and restoring sufficient information
for a [Process](202210062301.md) such that it can resume its function after
being [interrupted](202404141448.md). It is a major contributor to response
times.

Information such as registers' contents, program counter, coprocessor registers'
contents, memory page registers, [Memory-Mapped I/O](202404061058.md) location
mirror images, or special variables should be considered during context
switching. Interrupts are Disable during critical context-switching period
within the interrupt handlers. If partial but sufficient context has been
stored, interrupt may be re-enabled so that the interrupt handlers can handle a
burst of interrupts, detect spurious interrupts, or handle a time-overloaded
condition.
