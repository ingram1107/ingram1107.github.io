# NoSQL

NoSQL is a [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md) that is based on
non-relational [Data Model](202302101219.md) that can store variety of data
format including [tabular](202302101331.md), documents (usually JSON), graph,
key-value etc. Despite the name, NoSQL can include SQL for querying purposes.
Most NoSQL databases are scalable (by [Clustering](202304251207.md)) and
distributable. The search up to the database is rather efficient as there is no
relation between tabular data. It can come to the aid in application development
speed since it avoids the hassle to map application data to the database model.

It is advised to separate different data format into isolated keyspaces to avoid
potential conflicts and confusion.

**Note**: In Apache Cassandra, there is no `JOIN` operation unlike in usual SQL.
