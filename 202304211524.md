# Fast Retransmission

Fast retransmission, proposed in RFC 2581, is a mechanism in
[TCP](202206151232.md) that retransmits the missing packets before the
expiration of the segment's time by sending out three duplicated ACKs. This
mechanism allows the TCP sender to detect and repair packet loss without wasting
efficiency.
