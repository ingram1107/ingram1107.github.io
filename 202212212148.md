# SNMPv2 1993

#[SNMPv2](202212211531.md), later revised in 1996, is a revision to
#[SNMPv1 1988](202212212140.md) specified by RFC 1901 - 1908 which supports
distributed network and adds more functionality to it. It improves the
performance, security, confidentiality, and manager-to-manager communications.

SNMP supports both central and distributed management (multiple
[Management Station or Manager](202212211516.md) with a pool of
[Management Agent](202212211524.md)) as each device in the network maintains
local [Management Information Base (MIB)](202212211528.md). The communication is
usually done in [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)# but SNMPv2
allows the use of [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)# too.

Get commands are not atomic in SNMPv2.
