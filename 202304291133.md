# Builder Pattern

Builder pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that separate complex
object construction from its representation such that its construction process
can create different representations or solutions from it. In other words, it
encapsulates the representation, internal structure, and the assembly of the
resulting product. Builder pattern defines four participants: **builder**
(abstract interface for creating part of a product object), **concrete
builder**, **director** (constructs object via builder), and **product**
(represents a complex object under construction). Concrete builder implements
the interface of the builder class, defines and keeps track of the created
representations, and provides interface for the product object retrieval. In
other words, concrete builder is the one that produce the product needed by the
director.

**Note**: Usually, the concrete builder doesn't need to implement all methods
from the builder interface. To make the intention clear in
[C++](202302190651.md), define them at the builder class as empty methods
instead of pure virtual methods as following:

```cpp
class Builder {
public:
    virtual buildPart() { };
    // other empty methods
private:
    // ...
}
```

The Gang of Four advised us to have builder pattern if:
1. The complex object creation #algorithm should be independent of parts that
   make up the object and how they are assembled.
2. The construction process must allow different representations for the object
   that's constructed.

The pattern improves the modularity of the project since it encapsulates the
complex object's construction and representation as the client doesn't need to
know the internal structure of the object. Unlike [Abstract Factory Pattern](202303271021.md),
it constructs the product step-by-step under the director object's control
instead of immediately return the product. This is due to the fact the product
representations may vary greatly, and it is not possible to have a uniform
abstract interface for them. Comparing to other creational patterns, it
certainly has finer control over the construction process.
