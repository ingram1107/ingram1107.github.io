# Docker File

```docker
# INSTRUCTION   Argument
FROM Ubuntu   #start from base OS/another img

RUN apt-get update            #install dependencies
RUN apt-get install python    #install dependencies

RUN pip install flask         #install dependencies
RUN pip install flask-mysql   #install dependencies

COPY . /opt/source-code       #copy file (from local system to image)

ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP=/opt/source-code/app.py flask run  #run when image run
```

The file above could be built into #[202202211632](202202211632.md) using the command `docker
build {filename}`. The tag name that associated with this build could be
specified by the option `-t`.

`CMD` instruction could be used instead of `ENTRYPOINT` if the default command's
parameter is not desired for changes. `CMD` could act as the default parameter
pass to `ENTRYPOINT`, but in this way they have to be written in JSON list
format. `ENTRYPOINT` could be overridden by the option `--entrypoint` from
`docker run`.

Each instruction represents *each layer*. The building of the image will proceed
layer by layer where the success layer will be cached. This speed up the process
of image construction if the previous build was a failure. The size of each
layer could be checked by the command `docker history {image-name}`. These layer
compose of one single layer, **image layer**, that is read only once built.

There is a layer that run on top of image layer. It is **container layer**. See
#[202203281423](202203281423.md).
