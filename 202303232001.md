# Unix Domain Socket

Unix domain socket is a form of [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md)
that utilises the underlying Unix networking facilities and has a similar
interface to [Socket Programming](202202172152.md) (with `AF_UNIX` as the
protocol type). It supports both connection-oriented (`SOCK_STREAM`) and
connectionless (`SOCK_DGRAM`) protocols, which are equivalent to
[TCP](202206151232.md) and [UDP](202206151759.md) respectively.

We can create a bidirectional stream pipe (in contrast to
[Pipe](202210280908.md)) with the system call `socketpair()` by passing
`AF_UNIX`, the type of the transport protocol used, the type of application
protocol (can be 0), and a 2-element-size [File Descriptor](202210172248.md)
array. This means that we only need to create a stream pipe for a two-way
communication. By default, all stream pipes are unnamed. To name them, we can
attach (`bind()`) a Unix address to the stream pipes.
