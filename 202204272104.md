# Feynman Technique

Feynman Technique is a learning-by-teaching technique where you try to explain
an idea, which you are studying, as to a 12-year-old child. If the explanation
is not simple enough or too confusing, this means that you don't really
understand the topic, and you need to either to review the topic or refine your
rhetoric.

That being said, it is not **scientifically tested**, and its theory is
contradictory. Since different people have different cognitive ability, some
information will lose due to the simplification in order for the listener to
understand. This means that although the explanation could satisfy for a
12-year-old child, it doesn't necessarily mean that the explanation is clear and
verbose to more advance leaner.

See [Dialogic Learning](202205071138.md) for scientific approach to learning or
teaching that is similar to this.
