# Information Theory

Information Theory is a quantitative [measure of the information](202209291005.md)#
contained in message signals and allows us to determine the capacity of the
communication system to transmit [information](202209291015.md)# from source to
destination. It deals with the mathematical modelling and analysis of a
[communication system](202210042126.md)#. The laws of probability are applied to
Information Theory. It covers [Source Coding Theorem](202209291028.md)# and
[Channel Coding Theorem](202209291049.md)#.
