# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

Chain of responsibility pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that
chains receiving objects together, start from the most specific and end at the
most general, and passes the request until one of them could handle it. The
handler could implement the successor link. This pattern avoids
[coupling](202202041514.md) sender to receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle a particular request.

The Gang of Four advised to use this pattern when:
1. More than one object may handle a request, and the handler is not known a
   priori. The handler should be ascertained automatically.
2. There is a need to issue a request to one of several objects without
   specifying the receiver explicitly.
3. The set of objects can handle request should be specified dynamically.

Chain of responsibility pattern simplify the object interconnections as it
maintains only a single reference to a single successor. Thus, increase the
flexibility in assigning responsibilities to the objects which could be changed
at runtime or by subclassing. The successor chain can be implemented in either
new defined links or existing links using parent class's references (as in
[Composite Pattern](202302101843.md) or #data-structure like
[Tree](202112101956.md)). The latter solution saves some space. Either case, the
pattern doesn't guarantee a recipient, meaning the request may not be handled in
the end.

One may define an additional class called Request for more open-ended request
handling, but such solution is less save when comparing to the above-mentioned
pattern.
