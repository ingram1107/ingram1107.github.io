# Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)

Concentrated Solar Power is one of the methods to generate
#[202206291055](202206291055.md). It concentrates a large area of sunlight onto
a receiver using lens or mirrors. Then, lights received will be converted into
thermal energy which will be used to drive a heat engine, usually a steam
turbine (water use is a concern), that is connected to an electrical power
generator.

Compare to PV, especially without battery, CSP has an easier time on storing
energy during the night using molten salts, which makes possible for the
electricity generated dispatched by demand at the request of power grid
operators. Regions that received high solar radiation annually are vastly
benefitted from this technology.

However, due to high prices and technical difficulties, CSP is not as widely
adopted as its other siblings. Adding to the matter, CSP requires more spaces.
Birds whose habitats are near to the site are in high risks as they are exposed
to the highly concentrated solar radiation without any proper protection.
Passive cooling is necessary for the CSP to avoid the deterioration of the
components.
