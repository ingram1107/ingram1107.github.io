# Function

Function $F$ from set $A$ to set $B$ is a kind of #[202204282024](202204282024.md) with domain
$A$ and co-domain $B$ that satisfies two properties:
1. For every element of $x$ in $A$, there is an element $y$ of $B$ such that
   $(x, y) \in F$. ($x$ and $y$ must in the domain and co-domain respectively
   where $x$ is the first element of the ordered pair of $F$, and every $x$ must
   be related to at least one of the element in co-domain)
2. For all elements $x$ in $A$ and $y$ and $z$ in $B$, if $(x, y) \in F$ and
   $(x, z) \in F$ then $y = z$. ($x$ has **only one** related element in the
   co-domain)

Based on this definition, the unique element in $B$ related to $x$ by $F$ is
denoted $F(x)$, read "F of x". We can understand it as $F(x)$ is the output or
result of input $x$ in the function $F$. A function could be express in
[202204281700](202204281700.md) as $F = \{(x, y) \in A \times B|y = F(x)\}$. (relation is a
[202204281535](202204281535.md) of [202204281601](202204281601.md) of $A$ and $B$)

Two function is *equal*, that is $f = g$, if and only if, $f(x) = g(x)$ for
every $x$ in set $A$.
