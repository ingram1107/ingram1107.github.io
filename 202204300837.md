# Ansible Collection

Collection is a data structure used to store several #[202204272021](202204272021.md)
components such as [202204272036](202204272036.md)#, [202204300820](202204300820.md)#, [202205042207](202205042207.md)#
(could be multiple of them), [202204300825](202204300825.md)#, documentations and tests. The
components could be updated asynchronously and independently without affecting
the Ansible runtime. It is usually used for #[content delivery](202205051149.md)
in tar ball.

A typical directory structure for collection looks like this:

```
collection/
  MANIFEST.json
  playbooks/
    deployment.yaml
    ...
  plugins/
  README.md
  roles/
```
