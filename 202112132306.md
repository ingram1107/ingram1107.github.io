# Thread Detachment in Pthread

After #[thread creation](202112061056.md), one would have the need to detach these
threads from the main process especially when the main function has a large code
section to execute with. To do this, there are two ways in Pthread library: call
`pthread_detach` or set `pthread_attr_t` upon the thread creation.

`pthread_detach` is straight forward, we could just pass in the thread that we
want to detach:

```c
pthread_detach(th); // Detach thread `th`
```

However, a much better way to do this is by setting the thread's attribute. This
is where `pthread_attr_t` comes in handy. Since `pthread_attr_t` is an object,
we need to initialise it by calling `pthread_attr_init`. After that, set the
attribute `PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED` by calling the function
`pthread_attr_setdetachstate`. When creating a thread using `pthread_create`,
pass in the attribute in its second parameter. Lastly, destroy it like any other
objects by calling `pthread_attr_destroy`. In this way, we could avoid excessive
cost on function calling in a for loop.

```c
pthread_attr_t attr;

// in the program
pthread_attr_init(attr);
// to detach the thread
pthread_attr_setdetachstate(attr, PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED);

// in thread creation
pthread_create(&th, &attr, &routine, NULL)

// at the end of the program
pthread_attr_destroy(attr);
```
