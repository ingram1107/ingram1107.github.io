# Cache Access Optimisation

[CPU Cache](202403191017.md) access can be optimised by **structure
rearrangement** and/or [**alignment**](202203061200.md).

It is recommended by Drepper to arrange `struct` elements in a way that those of
critical word are put at the beginning of the `struct` and the rest in a likely
accessed order. However, such reordering will not help if the object is not
aligned. We can state their explicit alignment requirement with
`posix_memalign()` and/or `__attribute(aligned(N))`. Note that these solutions
don't work for array as only the first element is affected.

`posix_memalign()` requires parameters of a memory pointer to the dynamically
allocated memory area, the alignment requirement, and the size of the memory
pointer. It comes with a downside where it could lead to fragmentation and/or
increase memory consumption. This is the same for `__attribute(aligned(N))` if
it is used on objects allocated by the compiler (in `.data`, `.bss`, etc., and
on the stack). If instead `__attribute(aligned(N))` is applied on a type (entire
`struct`), the compiler will assign the appropriate alignment for every element
in the type including array, though dynamically allocated element still require
manual alignment (`posix_memalign()`).

**Note**: Functions that have no multimedia operations don't need strict
alignment. GCC flag `-mpreferred-stack-boundary=N` where $N$ defines $2^N$
provides a mean to relax the alignment requirement which reduces the program's
binary size, though this is [architecture](202403151651.md)-specific and not
always applicable to all processors.
