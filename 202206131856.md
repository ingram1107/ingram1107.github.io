# Application Layer

Application Layer is the seventh layer in the #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
The main functionality for it is to provide networking services to user or
application, for it to be ready to be sent down all the way down to
[Physical Layer](202206131647.md). Networking engineers usually refer
[Session Layer](202206131849.md), [Presentation Layer](202206131853.md) and this
layer as a single layer called Application Layer.

An application layer protocol should define the types of messages exchanged,
syntax of the various message types, the semantics (meaning) of the fields, and
the rules for determining when and how a process sends messages and responds to
messages. There are several protocols available in this layer:
- [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)](202302251327.md)
- Terminal emulation (Telnet, remote login to network hosts)
- [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](202210221515.md)#
- [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md)#
- [X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)](202205182136.md)#
- [Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md)#
- [Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)](202303021112.md)
- [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](202212211531.md)#
- [Routing Information Protocol (RIP)](202210160908.md)#
- [Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3)](202302251342.md)
- [Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)](202302251406.md)
- [Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)](202304092140.md)
