# Application Layer

Application Layer is the seventh layer in the #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
The main functionality for it is to provide networking services to user or
application, for it to be ready to be sent down all the way down to
[Physical Layer](202206131647.md). Networking engineers usually refer
[Session Layer](202206131849.md), [Presentation Layer](202206131853.md) and this
layer as a single layer called Application Layer.

There are several protocols available in this layer:
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP, transfer of mail messages and
  attachments)
- Terminal emulation (Telnet, remote login to network hosts)
- [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](202210221515.md)#
- [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md)#
- [X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)](202205182136.md)#
- [Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md)#
- TFTP
- [Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)](202212211531.md)#
- [Routing Information Protocol (RIP)](202210160908.md)#
