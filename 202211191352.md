# Two Hats Analogy

As software developers, we have two hats. One is for **adding function** and one
is for **[Refactoring](202206032059.md)#**. Frequent change of hats are quite
common in software development as we want to refine the software to adhere to
the system requirements. Just that we need to be aware what hat we're currently
wearing. [Refactoring: Improving The Design of Existing Code](lit/@Fowler1999.md)

When we're adding function, we don't change the existing code as we should
merely add new capabilities and tests to the software. When we're refactoring,
no new functionalities or tests should be added to the codebase. The code's
internal structure should be the main changing focus when we are in refactoring
hat. The only exception for that is when an interface change force a change in
test.
