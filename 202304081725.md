# Design Principles

The following design principles describe the dos and don'ts of the
[Interaction Design (ID)](202303242118.md):
- Visibility: making clear instructions with visual cue, so the user know what
  to do next. (#automation might make a product more difficult to
  [use](202303242139.md))
- Feedback: sending back information such as sound, highlighting, animation etc.
  about what action has been done and allow the person to continue the activity.
- Constraint: restricting the kind of user interaction to avoid invalid input or
  option selection.
- Consistency: designing an interface to have similar operations and use similar
  elements for similar tasks to flatten user learning curve.
- Affordance: an object attribute that invites people to use it. (perceptual
  learning)

Consistency could be categorised into *internal consistency* and *external
consistency*. Internal consistency refers to designing operations to have the
same behaviours within the application. External consistency refers to designing
operations, interfaces etc. to be the same across applications and devices.
