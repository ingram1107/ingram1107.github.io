# Mathematical Statement

There are three most important kinds of mathematical statements:
- [Universal Statement](202204281245.md)#
- [Conditional Statement](202205062055.md)#
- [Existential Statement](202204281254.md)#

These statements could be combined to express a [Compound Statement](202205061208.md)#.

A mathematical statement usually consists of three parts: *domain*,
*hypothesis*, and *conclusions*. For example:

$$
\forall \text{ graphs } G, \text{ if } G \text{ is complete and bipartite },
\text{ then } G \text{ is connected}.
$$

The domain is "$\forall$ graphs $G$", the hypothesis is "if $G$ is complete and
bipartite", and the conclusion is "$G$ is connected".
