# Clustering Analysis

Clustering analysis is the organisation of a collection of unlabelled patterns
into clusters based on similarity. It is classified as unsupervised learning. It
could be used to group samples based on profile similarity and generate novel
hypothesis.

Clustering analysis could be done in several algorithms, i.e., **connectivity
models**, **centroid models**, **distribution models**, **subspace models**, and
**neural models**. Connectivity model builds models based on connectivity such
as in hierarchical clustering using distance as a metric. Centroid model
represent each cluster by a single mean vector such as in k-means algorithm.
Distribution model's clusters are based on statistical distributions. Subspace
model, e.g. in biclustering, models clusters with both cluster members and
relevant attributes. Neural model such as unsupervised neural network is the
self-organising map.
