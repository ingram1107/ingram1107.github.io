# Singleton Pattern

Singleton Pattern is a #[Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that ensure a class
has only one instance and can be accessed globally. This could be done by having
the class to track its sole instance and guarantee that no other instance can be
created even when requested. The access should be done in class operation.

The Gang of Four advised to Singleton Pattern when:
1. There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to
   clients from a well-known access point.
2. The sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be
   able to use the extended instance without code modification.

In Case 2, we could implement what is called as *registry of singletons* where
clients could register the subclass (using the Singleton's class operation) into
a well-known registry (e.g., a string list) which could be lookup later. Upon
the instantiation, the object should register itself to the Singleton with its
constructor.

The Singleton Pattern can be implemented using static variable `_instance` for
tracking in #cpp:

```cpp
class Singleton {
  public:
    static Singleton& Instance();
    Singleton(const Singleton&) = delete; // no copy constructor
    Singleton(Singleton&&) = delete;  // no move constructor
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&) = delete;  // no copy operator
    Singleton& operator=(Singleton&&) = delete; // no move operator
  protected:
    Singleton();  // instantiation will fail since constructor is not accessible
                  // to others
  private:
    static Singleton& _instance;
};

Singleton& Singleton::_instance = 0;

Singleton& Singleton::Instance() {
  if (_instance == 0) {
    _instance = new Singleton;
  }
  return _instance;
}
```

However, Singleton Pattern's massive drawback is it hides dependencies and
increase [coupling](202202041514.md)# as Singleton violates the Single
Responsibility Principle (SRP). This makes [Unit Testing](202206201320.md) on
the Singleton and the codebase overall hard as there is hardly any circumvention
to prevent creating Singleton without affecting the state of the program.

Enforcing to have only one instance of object can be done by creating just one
instance of the object. And if global is needed, just use a global variable.
