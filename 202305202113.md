# PHP MySQL API

We can interact with [MySQL](202305032250.md) via the [PHP MySQL API](202305202113.md).
First, establish the connection with the database server via the function
`mysqli_connect()` with parameters of the server address, login user, and the
password. Access the database via the function `mysqli_select_db()` with the
MySQL handler (return value of `mysqli_connect()`) and database name as its
parameters. In the end, we should close the connection with the function
`mysqli_close` by passing the MySQL handler as the parameter.

After we have successfully selected the database that we want to access, we can
perform query (`mysqli_query()` with parameters of MySQL handler and the query
string), fetch the rows from a query (`mysqli_fetch_row()` with the parameter of
query result), or get the number of rows (`mysqli_num_rows()` with the parameter
of query result). If necessary, we can print out the error of the return
information from the function `mysqli_error()`.

**Note**: We have to sanitise the query input in order to avoid possible
[SQL Injection (SQLi)](202303072257.md).
