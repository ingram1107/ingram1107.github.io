# Cryptography

Cryptography is a study of encryption principles or methods, which transform an
intelligible (comprehensible) message into one that is unintelligible
(incomprehensible) and then re-transform it back to its original form. To put it
simply, it is a study of secret (crypto) writing (graphy).

Based on the cryptographic #algorithm used, we can put all cryptographic methods
into three groups:
- [Substitution Cryptography](202209281136.md)#
- [Permutation/Transposition Cryptography](202210052159.md)#
- Product Cryptography

We can categorise all cryptographic systems into two kinds based on the number
of keys used:
- [Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md)# (using only one secret key)
- [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md)# (using both private and public
  keys)

Not only that, we can also organise them according to the way in which plaintext
is processed:
- [Block Cipher](202209281239.md)#
- [Stream Cipher](202209281240.md)#

**Note**: We can't be certain of whether the cryptographic method or algorithm
is secure until we know the key size used for encryption and decryption.
However, if the key size is the same for [Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md)#
and [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md)#, then Symmetric Cryptography is
more secure.

Most encryption algorithms use exponentiation, accompany by [Modular Arithmetic](202210090858.md)#
as shown in the following equation:

$$
c = a^b \mod p
$$

The security of the encryption scheme depends on the difficulty of
[Factorisation](202210221918.md) to find out the prime numbers used to generate
the keys or secrets.
