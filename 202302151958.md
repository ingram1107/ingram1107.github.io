# Imperative Programming

Imperative programming is a [Programming Language Paradigm](202302152003.md)
based on the [von Neumann Architecture](202302151952.md) where the variable
represents the memory cell, assignment represents the pipe operation (media of
data transmission), and iterative of repetition (recursion).
