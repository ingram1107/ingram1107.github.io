# DNF

DNF inherits similar commands from [YUM](202409131546.md) while introduces newer
commands such as `provides` (equivalent to `whatprovides` in YUM), `list
--installed`, `repoquery -l` (list package contents), `repolist` (with options
of `--enabled` or `--disabled`), and `config-manager`.

`config-manager` provides flags for repository management, which includes
`--add-repo {url}`, `--set-enabled`, `--set-disabled` etc.
