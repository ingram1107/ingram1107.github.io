# Docker Container

Docker Container is a running instance of a [202202211632](202202211632.md)#. There are various
[202110201636](202110201636.md)# commands that interact with the [202204071114](202204071114.md)#.

To start a container instance, run the command `docker run {image-name}`. If the
[202202211632](202202211632.md)# does not exist in the local machine, it will instead pull from
remote or local repository, and then run it afterwards if the pull is
successful. See [202202211632](202202211632.md) for more information about the `docker pull`.
If specific version of image should be downloaded, define the tag in the format
`{image-name}:{tag}`. Otherwise, it will always download the `latest` tag
version of the image.

If the default process (defined as `CMD`, specified in [202110201654](202110201654.md)#) is not
the one you desire, you could override it with the format `docker run
{image-name} {CMD}`.

There are several options could be pass to `docker run`:
- `-d` to detach the container to the background,
- `-i` to run the container instance in an interactive mode,
- `-t` to attach a pseudo-terminal to the container,
- `-e {environment-variable}={value}` to set environment variable,
- `-p {client-access-port}:{app-listen-port}` to establish a
  [socket](202203171238.md),
- `-v {volume-name}:{path}` to attach a [persistent volume](202203251354.md),
- `--name` to name the container,
- `--link` to establish a connection between two containers,
  ([deprecated](202110201655.md))
- `--cpus={percent}` to limit the CPU usage (using #[202204071051](202204071051.md)),
- `--memory={size}` to limit the memory usage (using #[202204071051](202204071051.md))

A detached container could be brought up again by calling `docker attach
{container-id}/{container-name}`. It will then occupy the current shell just
like the default behaviour of `docker run`.

`docker exec {container-id}/{container-name} {commands}` could be used to
execute the commands inside the specified container.

`docker ps` lists all running containers in the local machine. If you want to
see more than just the running instances, you could pass in the option `-a` for
more verbosity.

We could obtain the detail information about the container by using two
commands: `docker inspect {container-id}/{container-name}` or `docker logs
{container-id}/{container-name`. `docker inspect` will output the information
into JSON format whereas the `docker logs` will output the log instead if the
container is running.

In order to stop a container, we could use the command `docker stop
{container-id}/{container-name}` where we pass in either container ID or its
name. These information could be obtained from the command `docker ps`.

Removing a container could be as easy as calling the command `docker rm`.

## Container Layer

Upon running, #[202110201636](202110201636.md) will create a layer on top of *image layer*
(describe in #[202110201654](202110201654.md)). The changes of file which located in image
layer will be done in #[202203251058](202203251058.md) where all the changes will happen in
container layer.

If the container stop running, all the changes or data will vanish. To store
those information, attach the container to [202203251354](202203251354.md).
