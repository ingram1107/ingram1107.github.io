# Supervisory Controls

Upon employment, managers should observe new and inexperienced employees within
the limits of law, and always consult with legal professionals to determine the
legality of monitoring. There should clear policies about which activities are
being monitored in the workplace. If criminal activity is suspected or
identified during monitoring, contact legal counsel and appropriate law
enforcement.
