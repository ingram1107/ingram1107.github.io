# Lines of Code (LOC) Estimation

LOC estimation is a direct approach to [Estimation Decomposition Technique](202305140747.md).
It identifies the major software functions then estimate the LOCs. However, this
estimation is highly dependent on the #programming-language used, ignores the
code generators, and varying code complexity based on the software developed.
