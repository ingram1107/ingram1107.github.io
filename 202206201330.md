# Integration Testing

Integration Testing is a testing on the interaction of major subsystems in the
project between each other. This means that the contract set upon the subsystem
must be honoured during the testing.

It can be quite similar to what of [Unit Testing](202206201320.md) as the latter
also emphasises the importance of testing subcomponents before testing the main
module.

[Regression Testing](202206201335.md)# could be done on Integration Testing to
validate the tests.
