# Integration Testing

Integration Testing is a testing on the interaction of major subsystems in the project between each other. This means that the contract set upon the subsystem must be honoured during the testing.

It can be quite similar to what of [202206201320](202206201320.md) as the latter also emphasises the importance of testing subcomponents before testing the main module.

[202206201335](202206201335.md)# could be done on Integration Testing to validate the tests.
