# Integration Testing

Integration Testing is a testing on the interaction of major subsystems in the
project between each other. This means that the contract set upon the subsystem
must be honoured during the testing. It is a systematic technique for
constructing the program structure while conducting tests to uncover errors
regarding interfacing.

It can be quite similar to what of [Unit Testing](202206201320.md) as the latter
also emphasises the importance of testing subcomponents before testing the main
module. Integration testing takes unit tested components and build a program
structure dictated by the contract. It can be done in a
[top-down](202305291923.md) or [bottom-up](202305291925.md) manner.

[Regression Testing](202206201335.md)# could be done on Integration Testing to
validate the tests.
