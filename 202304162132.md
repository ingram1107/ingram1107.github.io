# Requests for Quotation (RFQ)

RFQ is a document that an organisation submits to one or more potential
suppliers eliciting (draw out) quotations for a well-defined product or service.
The purpose of this document is mainly to know the costs (and less detail on the
product specification) from different vendors' solution and pick one of them. It
can be used for bidding, in other words, to obtain quotations for well-defined
procurements (acquisition).
