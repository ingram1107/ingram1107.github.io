# Weighted Round Robin Algorithm

Weighted round robin algorithm is a [Traffic Shaping](202302201414.md) technique
used in [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) that selects packets from a
set of queues according to a set of weights that divide the capacity into fixed
percentages. An assumption made here is that the packet size is in uniform.
