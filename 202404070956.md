# Community Antenna Television (CATV)

CATV utilises [Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md) to
deliver many channels through coaxial cable, which is less prone to
electromagnetic interference.

CATV can provide up to 52 Mbps downstream data rate and 512 kbps upstream data
rate, but with the caveat that it is shared among subscribers.
