# Flash Memory

Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile memory utilising charge trap flash
(CTF) memory cells that detect bits by observing the released electrons.
Directly overwriting the stored content is not possible, instead the medium will
first erased the content stored and then rewritten into the memory cells. Flash
memory can be categorised into two kinds: **NOR flash memory** and **NAND flash
memory**. NOR flash memory allows random access to individual words of memory in
which its speed is comparable to RAM. NAND flash memory on the other hand reads
in pages, typically 512 to 4,096 bytes, which is slower than its NOR counterpart
but cheaper and allows higher storage capacity.

**Note**: Erasing content is much slower than read. This can be improved by
having logical-physical page mapping.

Most of the flash memories have wear levelling that evenly distribute erase
operations across physical block so that each memory cell will have roughly even
lifespan. All instructions are carried out by flash translation layer.
