# Datagram Network

Datagram network forwards packets based on the portion of host destination
address of their header during [decapsulation](202210012046.md). The working
mechanism of the network is a like a postman service. The postman will refer to
the address revealed on the enveloped and passes it to the neighbour postman
that is closer to the destination. The process repeat until the postman can
deliver the mail to the exact location of the home address. The network
[Routers](202207061800.md) doesn't maintain the state information of the
[virtual circuit](202302161655.md) as there is none to begin with. The network
devices typically rely on [Routing Protocols](202207061815.md) to slowly
maintain the forwarding state information in [Routing Table](202210112056.md).
