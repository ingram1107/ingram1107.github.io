# Resource Management

A good resource management will achieve #[202202012306](202202012306.md).

Always perfer *Rule of Zero* for business-logic classes or when there is no need
for direct resource management. When resource management is inevitable, follow
*Rule of Three*, *Rule of Five* or *Rule of Four*.

## Rule of Zero

In *Rule of Zero*, there is no need to manually initialise anything. We could
just use the default destructor, copy constructor and copy assignment.

```c++
class Resource {
  // ...

public:
  Resource(const Resource&) = default;
  Resource& operator=(const Resource&) = default;
  ~Resource() = default;
}
```

## Rule of Three

In *Rule of Three*, we need to pay attention to three components: destructor, copy constructor and copy assignment.

Consider the following class:

```c++
class Resource {
  int *ptr_;
  size_t size_;

public:
  Resource() : ptr_(nullpr), size_(0) {}
}
```

Destructor is used to clean-up resources that is about to be out of scope in
order to prevent memory leak. This is especially useful in #exception handling
as it inevitably meddles with the resource management if destructor is not used.
In this example, we are going to **destroy the integer pointers**.

```c++
  ~Resource() { delete [] ptr_; }
```

However, in some special cases when the resources are copied, double frees could
be happened. Copy constructor is used to handle this situation.

```c++
  Resource(const Resource& rhs) {
    ptr_ = new int[rhs.size_];
    size_ = rhs.size_;
    std::copy(rhs.ptr_, rhs.ptr_ + size_, ptr_);
  }
```

However, there is an edge case that double frees could still happen. We need
copy assignment operator instead. Before that, we have to understand the
difference between initialisation and assignment.

```c++
Resource w = v; // initialisation: call copy constructor

Resource w;
w = v;          // assignment: call copy assignment operator
```

Applying copy and swap idiom for copy assignment operator as below:

```c++
  Resource& operator=(const Resource& rhs) {
    Resource copy = rhs;
    copy.swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }
```

Where swap could be defined like this:

```c++
  friend void swap(Resource& a, Resource& b) {
    a.swap(b);
  }

  void swap(Resource& rhs) {
    using std::swap;
    swap(ptr_, rhs.ptr_);
    swap(size_, rhs.size_);
  }
```

We could explicitly state that this class is non-copyable by using `delete`
keyword.

```c++
  Resource(const Resource&) = delete;
  Resource& operator=(const Resource&) = delete;
```

## Rule of Five

*Rule of Five* is an addition to *Rule of Three* for correctness and
performance. It adds two move rules: move constructor and move assignment
operator, which are aim at rvalues.

For move constructor:

```c++
  Resource(Resource&& rhs) {
    ptr_ = std::exchange(rhs.ptr_, nullptr);
    size_ = std::exchange(rhs.size_, 0);
  }
```

And for move assignment operator using copy-swap idiom:

```c++
  Resource& operator=(const Resource&& rhs) {
    Resource copy(std::move(rhs));
    copy.swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }
```

## Rule of Four

*Rule of Four* is an alternative version of *Rule of Five* with the exclusion of
move assignment operator. Instead, it uses a by-value assignment operator which
do copy and move.

```c++
  Resource& operator=(Resource rhs) {
    copy.swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }
```
