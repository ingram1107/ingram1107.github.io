# Virtualisation

Virtualisation is the abstraction of computing resources, which is a technique
for hiding the physical characteristics of the computing resources, such as
hardware, network, storage, etc., from the end users. Files associates with the
virtualised OS, application, and support software are saved in a one big file or
virtual disk. The state of [Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md) can be saved
to the disk so that it can be restarted by reloading the data from the disk.

The [Return On Investment (ROI)](202305062039.md) of virtualisation is higher
than those nonvirtualised servers. It depends less on the [Data Centre](202210012205.md)'s 
and IT equipment's density. Virtualisation also offers great scalability to the
customers as they can expand or shrink their pool as they will.
