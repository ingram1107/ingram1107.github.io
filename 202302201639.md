# Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM)

PIM is a multicast [Routing Protocol](202207061815.md) that is independent of IP
routing protocol and can leverage whichever unicast routing protocols are used
to populate the unicast [Routing Table](202210112056.md). It uses unicast
routing information to perform the multicast forwarding function to determine
the shortest path for each multicast group by utilising Reverse Path Forwarding
(RPF).

PIM can operate in three modes:
- **sparse mode** where PIM employs a pull model where the traffic is sent to
  hosts only when they explicitly ask to receive it. This is accomplished by
  join message to the [rendezvous point](202302201809.md) (RP, a router) where
  the multicast transmitters are registered.
- **dense mode** where PIM employs a push model where the
  [Router](202207061800.md) floods the messages out to all ports in which prune
  message is sent back if there is no subscribed members in the network.
- **sparse-dense mode** developed by Cisco where the network intelligently
  determines which above mode to use.

PIM solution works in a corporate network, but it is impossible to across the
Internet and shared IP networks. Multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (MBGP) is
the replacement for PIM if scalable multicasting is needed.
