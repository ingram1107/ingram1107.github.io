# Rust Unsafe

`unsafe` relives the compiler checks on [raw pointer](202408301540.md)
dereference, the call of `unsafe` function or method (`unsafe fn`), access or
modification on mutable [`static`](202408301545.md) variable, implementation of
`unsafe` [Rust Trait](202204061235.md), access `union`'s fields. Other safety
checks are still performed by Rust compiler.

**Note**: Libraries built with other #programming-language are deemed unsafe
from Rust point of view. This fall under the categories of `unsafe` function
too. (See more in [Rust Import Functions From Other Programming Language](202408301527.md)).

To minimise risks while using `unsafe` feature, it is advised to keep `unsafe`
block small, and wrap safe abstraction over `unsafe` to create safe API for the
users.
