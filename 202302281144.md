# Non-constructive Proofs of Existence

Non-constructive proofs of existence is one of the [Mathematical Proof Methods](202302281137.md)
that trying to prove an [Existential Statement](202204281254.md). Suppose the
following statement:

$$
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } Q(x)
$$

Instead of trying [Constructive Proofs of Existence](202302281138.md), we can
show either the existence of a value of $x$ that makes $Q(x)$ true is guaranteed
by an axiom or a previously proved theorem or that the assumption that there is
no such $x$ leads to [Contradiction](202206172158.md).
