# How a car engine work?

For one cylinder, there are four steps for it to convert the fuel into
horsepower: intake, compression, exhaust, stroke, then exhaust. During the
intake part, the input springer will be open to let the air in. Later, the
compression begin, where the input springer is sealed while the lower springer
compresses the air inside. Then, there will be an electric strike using fuel, to
ignite the air. Finally, the exhausted air will be output via the open output
springer.

Multiple cylinders could be used. For example, V6 engine means a V-shape engine
with 6 cylinders. Correspondingly, V8 engine means a V-shape engine with 8
cylinders. Each cylinder will be synced so that it could output the most
horsepower in a minute. We can say that it is one revolution when every
cylinder has performed their cycle. The performance of an engine can be
calculated using RPM, revolution per minute.
