# Optimisation Measurement

## CPU

We could use `perf` and *flame graph* which visualise the CPU time usage by the
program in its lifetime to investigate whether there are opportunities in
improving CPU time.

Be aware that when measuring the program execution time or CPU cycle, it will
inevitably introduce biases into the measurement since the program or code that
used for the measurement will need the time for themselves too.

## Memory

For JavaScript and its variants, we could use the inspect option provided by
*node* to visualise the memory usage by the program in its lifetime to
investigate whether there are opportunities in improving memory usage.

Sometime, improving memory usage could drastically improve the performance of
one program.

## Layout and Multithreading

The layout of a program could affect its own performance regardless of its own
code. This means that the link order (changes of function address) and
environment variable size (moves of program stack) could be arbitrary for one
architecture which resulted in more or less cache conflict. Therefore, we need
to eliminate the layout differences by using a *stabiliser*, which randomises
the memory layout of the program, analyse it using [Null Hypothesis Significance Testing](202205072243.md)
and use causal profiler such as `coz` especially for programs that utilise
[parallelism](202202011808.md).

While using causal profiler, doing a virtual speed-up for the program (slow down
every component except for the component that is aimed to speed-up). Measures
which speed-up of a component is significant.

**To-do**: Learn more about casual profiler and stabiliser. Read the paper
Layout Biases Measurement.

## Note on -O3

The option `-O3` from most C/C++ compilers does not actually optimise the
program that much. Its effect on the program's performance is not significant.
