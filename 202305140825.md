# Object Point Estimation

Object point estimation is an indirect approach of [Estimation Decomposition
Technique](202305140747.md). The object points are computed using counts of the
number of screens at user interface, reports, and components needed. Like in
[Function Points (FP) Estimation](202305140810.md), we need to find out the
corresponding object point count for each domain value by $\text{Object point
count} = \text{Object point} \times \text{Weight}$ where the weight represents
the complexity. Sum up all the object point counts, and if necessary, discount
the total object point count if the project is a component based development or
a general software reuse. We can then calculate the estimated effort via the
following formula:

$$
\text{Estimated effort} = \frac{\text{Object points}}{\text{Productivity rate}}
$$

**Note**: The productivity rate is depends on the developer experiences and
maturity of the development environment.
