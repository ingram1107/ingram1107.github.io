# Cyclic Code Encoder

To encode a #[Cyclic Code](202212192231.md), we need to construct a circuit
including components such as a **gate**, **flip-flop** (a register that store
value), and **modulo-2 adder** (or simply a XOR logic gate). Each flip-flop
represents $g_i$ from [Generator Polynomial](202212192305.md)# where $0 < i < n - k$,
and to their right, there should be a modulo-2 adder connected to it depending
on the value of $g_i$. If $g_i$ is 0, this indicates that there is no
connection (otherwise it is a direct connection), thus no modulo-2 adder should
be installed to the right of the flip-flop $g_i$. Initially, all flip-flops
store a value of 0, and after the end of each shift round, the value will be
**shifted** to the right. The gate should be connected to the first flip-flop
and the last flip-flop. The input will be coming from the right to the left.

**Note**: The least significant bit from message will be evaluated first.

**Note**: We can verify the number of flip-flops needed by calculating the
parity bits $m = n - k$ for the cyclic code.

See [Cyclic Code Decoder](202212301703.md)# to see how to decode cyclic code in
low level.
