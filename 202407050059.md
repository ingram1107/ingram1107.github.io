# Redis

Redis is an in-memory [Database](202302101139.md) that stores data in main
memory, making it volatile. It is commonly used as a cache to more persistent
database, though with additional features like data persistence, JSON, search,
Redis Object Mapping etc., it is too possible to have Redis to store persistent
data.

Redis supports data types of **string**, **set** (all elements must be unique),
**list**, **hash**, and **ordered set**. While it doesn't support integer as the
primitive type, it does provide functions to manipulate integer-like string. All
array structure in Redis are 0-index, and negative integer indicates that the
indexing is counted backwards. For example, `-2` means the last *second* index.
It also maintains timestamps for every stored values. If a timestamp is set,
then the data is **volatile**. If the data does not expire, then the data is
**persistent**.

When dealing with ordered sets, we can rank or arrange their members in a
lexical order. And by that, we can use specifiers like `[` (inclusive), `(`
(exclusive), `+` (positive infinite), and `-` (negative infinite) to limit our
range in ordered sets or other data structure with more and fewer specifiers
available.

We can call Redis's API (in Node JS) by first establishing a client from the
function call `createClient()` with `password` and [`socket`](202202172152.md)
as its parameters.
