# Genetic Code

Genetic code refers to the [Codons](202308091320.md) that encode specific
[Amino Acid](202308082207.md) which are one start codon and three stop codons
with no overlapping. It is nearly universal (could be translated
cross-species) and degenerate or redundant, meaning different codons may encode
the same amino acid. It is the set of rules used by living cells to translate
information encoded within [Nucleic Acid](202308082154.md) into proteins by
using ribosome.
