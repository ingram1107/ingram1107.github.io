# Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

CHAP is an [authentication](202210040915.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md) that
relies on encrypted challenge (a hash) over the network communicated between the
server and the client.

CHAP applies three-way handshake mechanism similar to [TCP](202206151232.md).
Server sends the challenge hash over the network to the client, in which the
latter response with the password hash for comparison later at the server side.
This process occurs periodically during the connection session.

CHAP is rather vulnerable to [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md) as it has
only $2^{56}$ possible keys to crack.
