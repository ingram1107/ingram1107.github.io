# C++ Allocator

C++ Allocator is a class that dictate memory management and address model of
#[C++ Cointainer](202202241719.md). We can create an allocator for various memory allocation
policy such as stack allocation, per-thread allocation and Arena Allocation.

The usage of allocator mostly consists of `allocate` and `delloacate` functions
which could be treated as `new` and `delete` respectively. In fact, the default
allocator's implementation encapsulates the `new` and `delete` using the these
two functions.

There are two kinds of propagation involved in allocator design:
- [Lateral Propogation](202205161839.md)#
- [Deep Propagation](202205161841.md)#

For Deep Propagation, we could use `scoped_allocator_adaptor` for it. This could
be a help on Arena Allocation.

Modern C++(14 and 17) introduce the polymorphic memory resources (`std::pmr`)
which is not Lateral Propagation. This means that the allocator will be able to
stick to the lifetime of the #[202202241719](202202241719.md). It includes allocators like
`synchronized_pool_resource`, `unsynchronized_pool_resource` and
`monotonic_buffer_resource`.
