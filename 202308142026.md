# Phylogenetic Tree

Phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram or a [Tree](202112101956.md) showing
the evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other
entities based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic
characteristics. Its branch's length is proportional to the number of [Amino Acid](202308082207.md)
differences between sequences.
