# Phylogenetic Tree

Phylogenetic tree is a branching diagram or a [Tree](202112101956.md) showing
the evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other
entities based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic
characteristics. A single node represents a taxonomic unit like species, genes,
or proteins. A branch represents the estimate time of the evolutionary
relationships among the taxonomic units Its branch's length is proportional to
the number of [Amino Acid](202308082207.md) differences between sequences. The
diagram can be depicted as **dendrogram** (scaled, and proportional to the
amount of evolutionary divergence), **cladograms** (unscaled branching
hierarchical tree), and **phylograms** (hierarchical
[cluster](202308212101.md)).

**Note**: Root depicts the common ancestor of the life forms in a **rooted
tree**. Further, the direction indicates the evolutionary time in such a tree.
An unrooted tree can do none of these.

We can find out all possible unrooted trees and rooted trees from
[the number of taxonomy](202308142025.md) $n$. For unrooted trees, calculate
$\frac{2n-5}{(n-3)2^{n-3}}$ where $n>2$. For rooted trees, calculate
$\frac{2n-3}{(n-2)2^{n-2}}$ where $n>2$.

From the tree, we could group nodes into sister groups, that is nodes that split
from the same ancestor, and outgroup, that is nodes that don't have this
feature. If a named taxon's constituent taxa are more closely related to one
another than any taxon outside the clade, then it constitutes a *monophyletic
clade*.

Distance-based data types' value are calculated by measuring the distance
between species or genes. Character-based data types' value are calculated based
on morphological features such as number of legs, hair, wings, scales etc. or
DNA/protein sequences. Character-based data types can be converted into
distance-based data types, but not the other way around.

The frequencies of branches are recorded as the bootstrap proportion, which is
used to measure the reliability of the branches in the tree. 95% bootstrap
support indicates a very good reliability. It is considered to be reasonably
good if it hits between 75% and 95%. If it is below 75%, then it has very poor
support. Below 50% is rejected, and such values should not be displayed on the
tree.
