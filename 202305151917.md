# Network Operating System

Network OS is a distributed system running on servers or controllers in the
network that creates a consistent, up-to-date network view. It can utilise the
[Forwarding Abstraction](202305151923.md) to get state information from and give
control directives to forwarding elements like [Router](202207061800.md) and
[Switch](202207051907.md).

Examples of network OS are:
- NOX
- ONIX
- Trema
- Beacon
- Maestro
