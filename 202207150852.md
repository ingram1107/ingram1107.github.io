# Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

MPLS is a #[Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) routing technique
operating between [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)# and [Network Layer](202206131702.md)
that delivers WAN and MAN services. It is one of the alternative to replace the
legacy [Frame Relay](202208291308.md), [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)
and [Point-to-Point/Leased Line](202207150843.md) as it can provide their
functionalities in a multiservice form without introducing dependencies on both
Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols. It also acts as an interface to other [Routing Protocols](202207061815.md).
Thus, it can be used to aggregate and transport Frame Relay, ATM, and
[IP-based](202206151238.md) (like [Ethernet](202207051550.md)) traffic, the
former two could be done using Any Transport over MPLS (AToM) technology. It
also provides the [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](202207150909.md)# technology.
Additionally, MPLS can act as a [flow control mechanism](202209302245.md). MPLS
doesn't handle [Label Distribution](202304261259.md), instead it relies on
[Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)](202304261308.md) for this purpose.


Architecturally, MPLS is divided into Control plane and Data plane. The former
is accountable for the exchange of routing information, including labels,
between adjacent devices. The latter will handle the forwarding operations.

There are three primary equipment types within a MPLS network: customer premises
equipment (CPE), provider edge (PE), and provider [routers](202207061800.md)
(P). CPE will be on the customer site, and all the traffic leaving the local
site is routed through it. PE, could be a [high-end switch](202207051907.md) or
router, is at the entry point of the service provider's network. P locates in
the core of the network, which will be responsible on forwarding packets based
on the labelling.

The operation in MPLS network can be generalised into five steps: **label
creation and label distribution**, **table creation**, **label-switched path
creation**, **label insertion or table lookup**, and **packet forwarding**.

Before the network traffic begins, the routers maps a label to a specific
[Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FEC)](202209282123.md) and build the table
there. With the help of [Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)](202304261308.md),
downstream routers initiate the label and mapping of label and FEC distribution
in which the traffic-related characteristics and MPLS capabilities are
negotiated through LDP. A reliable and ordered transport protocol will be used
for the signalling protocol. On receipt of label bindings each [Label Switching Router (LSR)](202305032302.md) creates entries in the label information base (LIB) table, and the
table contents will specify the label-FEC mapping, that is the mapping between
input port and input label table to the output port and output label table. That
is, by looking up to the table later, the LSR will be able to figure the next
hop where the request for label should be sent. Upon renegotiation of the label
bindings, the routers update the entries accordingly. [Label-Switched Paths (LSP)s](202305032308.md)
are created in reverse direction to the entry creation in the LIBs.

Within the WAN that implements MPLS, all packets will be assigned a fix-length
label by the ingress [Label Edge Router (LER)](202305032259.md) of the MPLS
network, based on [IP destinations](202206281021.md), IP sources, [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)#,
VPN membership or engineered specific routes by looking up to the LIB table and
initiates a label request. A label distribution will be triggered happen and an
LSP is set up. The packet will then be forwarded to the MPLS core routers, and
they will examine the label, replace it with the outgoing label and forward it.
As the packet reached the egress LER of the MPLS network, the label will be
removed from the packet.

Generally, MPLS 32-bit label sits between data link layer header and network
layer header in the frame with 20-bit label, 3-bit experimental bits (specify
CoS), 1-bit bottom of stack bit (BS, set if no label follows), and 8-bit time to
leave (TTL, like time to live). The label is used to differentiate the packets
from each other in the MPLS network. 

**Note**: The router that is allowed to add MPLS label to the packets is also
the only router that needs to process the entire packet header.

MPLS improves the packet-forwarding #performance in the network and QoS and
[Class of Service (CoS)](202305030823.md) for service differentiation in
addition of network scalability. It is also able to integrate IP and ATM in the
network and build interoperable network. However, MPLS requires additional layer
or header to be added to the frame, and the routers in the network has to be
able to understand its format in order to leverage its advantages.

Because of the rising concerns of the [Fabrication](202209262052.md)# of the
label, many entities have been opted for [IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)#
to enhance the traffic security while traversing MPLS networks.

Several enhancements are done in MPLS in order to improve the overall traffic
flow in the network. MPLS network chooses the shortest path for a traffic flow
based on the size and priority of a traffic flow with the help of the label.
Therefore, it can honour IP [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)#.
