# Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

MPLS is a #[Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) routing technique
operating between [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)# and [Network Layer](202206131702.md)
that delivers WAN and MAN services. It is one of the alternative to replace the
legacy [Frame Relay](202208291308.md), [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)
and [Point-to-Point/Leased Line](202207150843.md) as it can provide their
functionalities in a multiservice form without introducing dependencies on both
Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols. It also acts as an interface to other [Routing Protocols](202207061815.md).
Thus, it can be used to aggregate and transport Frame Relay, ATM, and
[IP-based](202206151238.md) (like [Ethernet](202207051550.md)) traffic, the
former two could be done using Any Transport over MPLS (AToM) technology. It
also provides the [Virtual Private Network (VPN)](202207150909.md)# technology.
Additionally, MPLS can act as a [flow control mechanism](202209302245.md).

Architecturally, MPLS is divided into Control plane and Data plane. The former
is accountable for the exchange of routing information, including labels,
between adjacent devices. The latter will handle the forwarding operations.

There are three primary equipment types within a MPLS network: **customer
premises equipment (CPE), provider edge (PE), and provider
[routers](202207061800.md) (P). CPE will be on the customer site, and all the
traffic leaving the local site is routed through it. PE, could be a
[high-end switch](202207051907.md) or router, is at the entry point of the
service provider's network. P locates in the core of the network, which will be
responsible on forwarding packets based on the labelling.

Within the WAN that implements MPLS, all packets will be assigned a label by a
[Router](202207061800.md) (just before entering the MPLS network), based on
[IP destinations](202206281021.md), IP sources, [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)#,
VPN membership or engineered specific routes, in order to differentiate from
each other in the MPLS network. The packet will then be forwarded to the MPLS
core routers, and they will apply appropriate services and forward it based on
its label. As the packet reached the destination edge of the MPLS network, the
label will be removed from the packet. They are usually 4 bytes (32 bits) long.
Note that MPLS doesn't handle [Label Distribution](202304261259.md), it relies
on [Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)](202304261308.md) for this purpose.

**Note**: The router that is allowed to add MPLS label to the packets is also
the only router that needs to process the entire packet header.

**Note**: Routers know the relationship between a label and path through the
network via [Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FEC)](202209282123.md)#.

Because of the rising concerns of the [Fabrication](202209262052.md)# of the
label, many entities have been opted for [IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)#
to enhance the traffic security while traversing MPLS networks.

Several enhancements are done in MPLS in order to improve the overall traffic
flow in the network. MPLS network chooses the shortest path for a traffic flow
based on the size and priority of a traffic flow. Therefore, it can honour IP
