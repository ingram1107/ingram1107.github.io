# Rust Borrowing Rule

Rust Borrowing Rule states that there can be either multiple immutable references or only one mutable reference at the same time. If such rule is violated, depending on the situation, the compiler will throw a compilation error or the program will panic during the runtime and crash itself instead (this is the case for #[202206232210](202206232210.md)).
