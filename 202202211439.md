# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an #[Application Layer](202206131856.md) protocol
that is used to manage the request and distribution of the hypertext documents.

## Request

To request for hypertext, the client need to specify three things: the HTTP
method, the request resource and the version of HTTP. A typical HTTP request
could look like this:

```txt
GET / HTTP/1.1
```

## Response

The web-server will need to respond to the client's request. It can indicate
that the client does not have the permission to retrieve the resource or simply
fetch the requested resource to the client.

Either way, it needs to include the status of the request in HTTP header in the
format: the version of HTTP, the status code and the status text. A typical HTTP
response would look like this:

```txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
