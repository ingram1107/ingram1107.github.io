# Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an #[Application Layer](202206131856.md) protocol
defined by RFC 1945 (HTTP/1.0) and RFC 2616 (HTTP/1.1) that is used to manage
the request and distribution of the hypertext documents. An HTTP server can work
under non-persistent way where the [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
is closed after an object requested is successfully sent to the client. However,
this can be a burden on the server if there are large amounts of clients trying
to connect to the server. Instead, the server can establish a persistent
connection instead where the connection is left open and a web page that contain
several objects are sent over the network at once instead of needing separate
TCP connections. If the connection hasn't been used for a while, then the server
will close it for good.

[Secure Socket Layer (SSL)](202212052009.md) and [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](202212052055.md)
can be used to complement HTTP (HTTPS) to provide secure the communications and
identification information over the Internet.

There are several methods defined in HTTP for the client and server to request
or response: `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD` (like `GET` but leaves out requested
objects), `PUT` and `DElETE` (delete object on the server).

## Request

To request for hypertext, the client need to specify three things: the HTTP
method, the request resource and the version of HTTP. A typical HTTP request
could look like this:

```txt
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.mmu.edu.my
Connection: close
User-agent: Mozilla/4.0
Accept-langauge: en
```

The `Connection` header indicates that the client wants a non-persistent
connection to the server.

## Response

The web-server will need to respond to the client's request. It can indicate
that the client does not have the permission to retrieve the resource or simply
fetch the requested resource to the client.

Either way, it needs to include the status of the request in HTTP header in the
format: the version of HTTP, the status code and the status text. A typical HTTP
response would look like this:

```txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Date: Mon, 20 Feb 2023 09:10:54 MST
Server: Apache/1.3.0 (Unix)
Last-Modified: Sun, 5 May 2022 09:23:24 MST
Content-Length: 6821
Content-Type: text/html

...
```

The `Content-Type` is based on the [MIME type](202211012200.md).
