# Attacker Capability Level

Attackers on IT infrastructure may have varying skill level which will influence
their attacking style and course of action. We can categorised them into three
levels: **elite or expert hackers**, **scriptwriters**, and **script kiddies**.

Expert hackers tend to be the one that is responsible for tools creation for
newly found exploitations. Scriptwriters are less skill in terms of finding
vulnerabilities, though they are skill capable of building scripts for known
security exploit. Script kiddies are mainly relied on only the tools built by
the former two and then execute them to impose security threat, and they are the
most numerous one.
