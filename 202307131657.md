# Filesystem-Persistent IPC

Filesystem-persistent [IPC](202210262136.md) is a kind of IPC where the object
exists unless it is explicitly told to be deleted. However, due to the
performance issue, most IPC implementor avoids such guarantee, and instead
favour over [Kernel-Persistent IPC](202307131645.md) or [Process-Persistent IPC](202307131641.md).
