# Double Hashing

Double Hashing is a strategy for #[202112131222](202112131222.md) that use two hash function
instead of one to search an empty cell in the [202112122035](202112122035.md).

## Details

- [202112122038](202112122038.md) is usually $F(i) = i \cdot \text{hash}_2(X)$

## Analysis

- The best second Hash Function is $R - (X \mod R)$
- Number of probes is almost equals to other
  [collision resolution strategy](202112131158.md)

## Attention

- The second Hash Function should never evaluate to 0
- Ensure that all cells in the Table can be probed
