# Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

EBS provides persistent block storage volume for use with [EC2](202401152149.md)
instances. Each volume created within [availability zone](202312011406.md) is
automatically replicated. It could be used as a boot volume for EC2 instance,
but it must be of SSD type. For backup, we can utilise snapshots (first one
called baseline snapshot) which are stored in [S3](202312132008.md).

**Note**: The snapshots on EBS take an incremental approach.

**Note**: [Encryption](202209281121.md) comes free.

There are four volume types provided by this service: general purpose SSD,
provisioned IOPS SSD (faster IOPS per volume and larger
[Throughput](202304111957.md) per volume), throughput-optimised HDD, and cold
HDD. The charge is based on the size of the volume, its usage (based on IOPS
metric), snapshots occupied spaces, and outbound data traffic.
