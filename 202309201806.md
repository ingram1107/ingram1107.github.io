# Perl Angle Brackets

Perl angle brackets around a file handler is treated as reading the file one
line at a time. If used with while, we can read the whole file until the end of
the file. Another usage is to read only the next line by assigning it to a
scalar variable. The following code shows its usage:

```perl
open(my $fh, 'input.txt') or die "could not open";
while(<$fh>) {
    ...
}

defined(my $line = <$fh>) or die "reach eof"
```
