# Event Register

Event register consists of a group of binary event flags used to track the
occurrence of specific events. Every task own its own event register so that it
could be notified by external source in the form of bit overwrite.

The control block on the event register contains the information of wanted
events, received events, timeout value, and notification conditions.

However, there are some limitations on the use of event register. The fact that
the data have to be transferred alongside with an event requires separate
storing and association mechanisms. In the case of accumulation of multiple
events, such association is deemed too complicated. Another limitation is that
there is no way to identify source of an event if there are multiple sources.
