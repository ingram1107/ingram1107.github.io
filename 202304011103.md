# System Requirements Specification (SRS)

SRS is a structured document detailing the description of the provided system
services. It can act as a basis for a contract between the contractor and the
customer. Once the #development team has drawn up an SRS, it is not possible to
add in feature from the customer since the [Requirements](202303251303.md) has
been frozen.
