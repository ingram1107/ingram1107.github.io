# Cyclic Code Structure

Cyclic code structure is a [Real-Time](202403301908.md)
[Kernel](202210062254.md) that defines a set of self-contained tasks in a
continuous loop. The task list can be dynamically adjust with
[list pointer](202110191729.md). [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md)
can be achieved with global variables.

The following shows the example code for this system:
```c
for(;;;) {
    task_1();
    task_2();
    ///
    task_n();
}
```

Cyclic code structure has adequate reactivity and simultaneity, and achieves
complete determinism and definite schedulability through proper synchronisation
via global variables. However, it is probably only best reserved for the
simplest real-time system as it is difficult to uniformly divide the tasks.
