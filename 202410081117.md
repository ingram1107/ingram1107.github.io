# Packet Radio

Packet radio is used for [Amateur Radio](202408231247.md) P2P communication
between 2 computers, which is popular in VHR or UHF [spectrum](202408251428.md).
A packet radio system usually consists of three components: a personal computer,
a [terminal node controller (TNC)](202410081123.md), and a radio.

Packet radio typically operates at the speed of 1,200 bps. 9,600 bps is also
available, with the caveat that the radio is required to support wide bandwidth
communication.

The advantages of using packet radio are its transparency, error correction, and
automatic control. User can network few stations and add the range coverage to
send packets.
