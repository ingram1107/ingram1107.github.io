# Database Conceptual Design Phase

During conceptual design phase, we have to translate the user's or application's
need into a high-level representation in which could be easily understood by the
user. To specify it in detail, we choose the best [Data Model](202302101219.md)
that can translate the [Requirements](202303251303.md) into a [conceptual schema](202304191446.md).
The focus point in this design phase is to describe the data and their
relationships between each other.
