# Batch Processing

Batch processing performs one-for-many interaction (one request may trigger
multiple internal processing logics) between a client and a server. Unlike
[Online Processing](202304202000.md), it doesn't need that much bandwidth as the
tasks with high bandwidth requirement could be queued at later time which
doesn't have much impact on the network #performance. By such, it is not
possible for a batch processing server to produce a fast response to the
client's request especially when there is an error which can halt the entire
batched task. Nevertheless, it is suitable for [System](202303242148.md) that
prioritise #security, audit, #privacy, and computer #resource utilisation due to
its relatively controlled environment and multiple-step processing method.
