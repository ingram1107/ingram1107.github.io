# Job Control

Job Control allows user to start multiple processes from a terminal and have
some control over their execution. It is introduced in 4.3BSD which is then
widely adopted by other Unix-like operating system including
#[Linux](202204081225.md). It requires support from the terminal driver, the
signal mechanism and the shell, meaning if the shell supports the Job Control
mechanism, but the underlying operating system doesn't, then it is not possible
to do Job Control on it.

Job Control is done through by assigning unique process group ID (`pgrp`) to the
process instead of inheriting its parent process `pgrp`. When a `SIGKIL` sent to
the parent process, it will not terminate of its children, instead, those child
processes will live a longer life than their parent.
