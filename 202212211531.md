# Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

SNMP is a lightweight #[Application Layer](202206131856.md)
[Protocol](202209302229.md)# allowing remote and local
#[management](202212211445.md)# of items or [Network Device](202207051821.md) on
the network. It is part of #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
SNMP comprises of two entities: agents who are running on
[managed node](202212211524.md) and collecting information about the node, and
managers who are running on [management workstation](202212211516.md) that
requests information about devices on the network.

**Note**: SNMP doesn't provide security management to the
#[Network Management System (NMS)](202212211503.md).

The managers issue `GetRequest`, `GetNextRequest`, and `SetRequest` messages to
[port](202206151841.md)# 161 which the agents should reply with `GetResponse`
message to the same port. The managers listen to the port 162 in case there is
a `Trap` message issued by the agents due to changes in [Management Information Base (MIB)](202212211528.md)
and underlying node.

There are three specifications of SNMP issued attempting to standardise SNMP
implementation:
- [SNMPv1 1988](202212212140.md)#
- [SNMPv2 1993](202212212148.md)#
- [SNMPv3 1998](202212212259.md)#

SNMP is universally supported and portable. It also quite extendible and allows
distributed management access.
