# Discrete Logarithms (DLOG)

DLOG is a hard problem in mathematics which is the inverse problem of
exponentiation of a number [modulo](202210090858.md)# $p$. For instance, to find
$x$ in $y = g^x (\mod p)$, it is written as $x = \log_g y (\mod p)$. If $g$ is a
[Primitive Root](202210232217.md)#, then DLOG always exists, otherwise it may
not.
