# Comparison Sort

Comparison Sort is a type of sorting algorithm that use simple comparisons such
as *larger than* and *lesser than*. From [202201171853](202201171853.md), while some of them
would perform in $O(N^2)$ in the worst case or even in average case, there are
some could perform in $O(N \log N)$ in the average case or even in the worst
case.

The reason for this is that for naive approaches, it is inevitable that we need
to do $N^2$ comparisons on $N$ elements since we need to compare element $i$ to
element $i + k$. The examples for such algorithms are:

- [202202220937](202202220937.md)#
- [202202232135](202202232135.md)#
- [202202232215](202202232215.md)#

To improve this, we could simply [eliminate more than one invertion](202202221025.md)
or use *divide-and-conquer* algorithms to get a $\Omega(N^2)$ or
quicker running time. The examples for such algorithms are:

- [202202241007](202202241007.md)#
- [202202232117](202202232117.md)#
