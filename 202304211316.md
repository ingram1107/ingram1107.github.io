# Star Network

Start network is a [Network Topology](202304211303.md) which has a
[Switch](202207051907.md), [Router](202207061800.md), or a device that resembles
both functionalities to manage the network and all its traffic. It is mostly
likely the first choice for the organisation that has cabling network needs as
it is simply to configure with and can be daisy-chained to switches with less
port numbers. For extension, we can use [Category 5 or Category 6 cables](202210111822.md)
where each cable can cover up to 100 metre.
