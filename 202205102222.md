# The Period of Day in Dutch

Like most languages, #[Dutch](202205102217.md) can describe day (*dag* in Dutch) in
several periods. Morning is *Ochtend* or *Morgen*. *Middag* describes afternoon.
Evening in Dutch is *Avond*. To say night, *nacht*.

When [greets](202205102219.md)#, just add *Goeden* (formal) or *Goeie* (less
formal) prefixes onto the period of day.
