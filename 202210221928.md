# Fermat's Theorem

Fermat's Theorem, aka Fermat's Little Theorem, is a special case of
#[Euler's Theorem](202210222028.md) which states:

$$
a^{p-1} = 1 (\mod p)
$$

Where:
- $p$ is a prime, and
- $GCD(a, p) = 1$ ([Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](202210092214.md)#).

It is particularly useful in [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md) and
primality testing (to test whether a number is a prime).
