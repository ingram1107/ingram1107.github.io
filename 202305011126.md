# Enterprise Integration Messaging

Messaging is an [Enterprise Integration](202305011106.md) having each
application connect to a common messaging system (like [enterprise service bus](202304301212.md)).
The facility provides a platform the applications to exchange their data, in
addition of the need of data format conversion, and invoke behaviour using
messages. The downside is that there is a limit of the data size that could be
fit into the messaging system as it has a fix bandwidth shared between different
components.
