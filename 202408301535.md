# Rust Export Function To Other Programming Language

To export Rust functions to other programming languages, `extern` is used again
with the specifier `pub` and `#[no_mangle]` (to disable [function mangling](202408301538.md)).
The following Rust codes show how can it be done:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn hello {
    ///
}
```
