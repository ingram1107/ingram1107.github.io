# System

System is an array of components designed to accomplish a particular objective
according to a plan. In [System Architecture](202303242154.md), it is
represented by graphs (configurations) of [Architectural Components](202303250940.md)
and [Architectural Connectors](202303250943.md), which in turn may represent the
internal architecture of the subsystems (hierarchical). Its overall topology is
defined independently of those in modern [Architecture Description Language (ADL)](202303242159.md).
