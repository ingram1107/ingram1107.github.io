# Algebraic Structure

Algebraic Structure is a collection of objects (don't have to be numbers), and
one or more *operations* could be performed on them. The following shows all the
Algebraic Structures, with the order of having the least common properties to
the most common properties:

1. [Group](202210082221.md)#
2. [Abelian Group](202210082309.md)#
3. [Ring](202210082256.md)#
4. [Communicative Ring](202210082310.md)#
5. [Integral Domain](202210082323.md)#
6. [Field](202210082303.md)#
