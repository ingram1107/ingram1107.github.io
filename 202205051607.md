# Ansible Templates

Templates use Jinja2 templating to generate files based on defined
#[202205042134](202205042134.md). Use the #[202204300820](202204300820.md) `template` inside
#[202204272036](202204272036.md). The following shows its usage:

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure apache is installed and started
  hosts: web
  become: yes

  vars:
    http_port: 80
    http_docroot: /var/www/mysite.com

  tasks:
    - name: Verify correct config file is present
      template:
        src: templates/httpd.conf.j2 # from local directory
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf # copy to this directory on remote hosts
```

```jinja2
# templates/httpd.conf.j2
Listen {{ http_port }}
DocumentRoot {{ http_docroot }}
```

**Note**: We could set `owner`, `group` and `mode` within the `template` module
in order to restrict permission to the file.
