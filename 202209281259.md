# Brute Force Attack

Brute Force Attack, aka Exhaustive Key Search, is a
#[Cryptanalysis](202209281128.md) technique that attempts to obtain an
intelligible plaintext by trying every possible key on a piece of ciphertext. On
average, $\frac{N}{2}$ number of keys must be tried before a success, where $N$
annotates the total number of possible keys. Therefore, we know that the time
used by Brute Force Attack is proportional to the key size: the larger the key
size, the longer the time taken to crack the algorithm.

For example, suppose the key size used is 32 bits. The total number of possible
keys should be $2^{32}$, and it requires $\frac{2^{32}}{2} = 2^{32 - 1} =
2^{31}$ attempts on average. Assume that the speed to decrypt is 1 decryption
per µs, it will be $2^{31}$ µs $= 2^{31} \times 10^{-6}$ s $= 2^{31} \times
10^{-6} \div 60$ min, which is $35.79$ minutes. If the speed to decrypt
increased to $10^6$ decryption per µs, it will be $\frac{2^{31}}{10^6}$ µs $=
2^{31} \times 10^{-6 - 6}$ s $= 2^{31} \times 10^{-12}$ s $= 2.147 \times
10^{-3}$ s or $2.147$ ms.

If a #[Cryptanalysis](202209281128.md) could crack an
[encryption scheme](202209281121.md) with an attempts less than of the Brute
Force Attack, then it is considered to be a [Cryptanalytic Attack](202209281257.md)
on the scheme.
