# Address Classes

Publicly assignable #[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) are divided into 5 classes
to accommodate the increasing demands. See the table below:

| Classes | First Octet Range | Network Bits | Host Bits |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| A       | 1-126             | 8            | 24        |
| B       | 128-191           | 16           | 16        |
| C       | 192-223           | 24           | 8         |
| D       | 224-239           |              |           |
| E       | 240-255           |              |           |

**Note**: Class D is utilised for [multicast](202209302253.md), so there is no
need to distinguish between network bits and host bits.

**Note**: Class E is reserved for research and development (R&D).

**Note**: Octet 127 can't be seen in the table with a reason: it is reserved for
local addressing. In fact, your local machine will have an address of 127.0.0.1
by default.

The network usually reserve the *first address* and *last address* of the octet
for network identification (which network is it) and broadcast (local)
respectively. From here, we can know the total number of assignable hosts in the
network by the formula $2^{BL} - 2$ where $BL$ denoted the *number of assigned
host bits* ($2^{BL}$ is the total number of hosts including the network address
and broadcast address). The total number of hosts calculation can be more
sophisticated with the introduction of #[Subnetting](202206280939.md). We also
get a magic number by dividing $2^{BL}$ by 256 until there is a remainder, which
will be the gap between assignable subnets.
