# Interpreter Pattern

Interpreter pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that defines the
representation of the [language grammar](202302152053.md) in sentences. It is
often used when there is a language to interpret that the statements can be
represented as syntax trees. Basic constructs involve **abstract expression**
for subclassing, **terminal expression** (literal expression) for terminal
symbols in the grammar including operations on them, and **non-terminal
expression** (alternation, repetition, sequence) which is required for every
rule in the language's grammar. In addition, non-terminal expression maintains
instance variables of type abstract expression for each symbol which could be
done recursively. **Context** must present in order to maintain global
information.

The Gang of Four suggests the best way to use the interpreter pattern are when:
1. The grammar is simple. Complex language should rely on parser generators
   instead.
2. There is no need to be efficient.

**Note**: Interpreter pattern doesn't define a way to create syntax tree for the
language, see [lexical analyser implementation](202302281733.md) instead.

Using this pattern makes grammar changes, extension, and implementation easy due
to inheritance and automatic generation by [Compiler](202302152015.md) or parser
generators. It also adds new ways to interpret expression, and [Visitor Pattern](202303071231.md)
can be useful to avoid changing grammar classes and maintain the behaviour in
each node if this is done often. But, when the grammar is getting more complex,
it will be hard to maintain. If that is the case, use parser or compiler
generator instead. In some way, it is similar to [Composite Pattern](202302101843.md),
thus sharing some issues too.
