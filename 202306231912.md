# Interpreter Pattern

Interpreter pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that defines the
representation of the [language grammar](202302152053.md) in sentences. It is
often used when there is a language to interpret that the statements can be
represented as syntax trees.

The Gang of Four suggests the best way to use the interpreter pattern are when:
1. The grammar is simple. Complex language should rely on parser generators
   instead.
2. There is no need to be efficient.
