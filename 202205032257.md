# URL Parsing

Specified by RFC3986, URL is composed of the beginning to the end: scheme
(protocol used), authority (domain name), path, query, and fragment (access to
the secondary resources). For example:

```
ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt
ldap://[2001:db8::7]/c=GB?objectClass?one
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30997420/what-are-fragment-urls-and-why-to-use-them#30997598
```

All URLs should be terminated by "/", "?" (the rest of strings are input
parameters), "#" or end of line defined by the standard.

Due to the limitation and inconsistency of the standard, URL parsing is exposed
to attacks from #[202204161849](202204161849.md). There are several libraries such as
[Advocate][1] and [SafeCurl][2] try to improve the current state of URL parsing
security.
