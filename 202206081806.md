# Python Convention

To indicate that the Python file is a script intended to be run and not as a
library, the author will put the following code in the file:

```python
def main():
  ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

The `main` function is defined instead of using bare statements is to avoid
declaring and defining variable(s) globally that could have resulted in
unexpected change of program state.
