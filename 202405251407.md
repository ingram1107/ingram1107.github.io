# System Clock

System clock is a [Timer](202404061106.md) that track either real-time or
elapsed time (how many times has passed) following system power up. Its initial
value could be retrieved from [Real Time Clock](202405251404.md) or set by user.
System clock is entirely driven by [programmable interval timer](202405251410.md),
such that it increments in value per timer interrupt. We can say that the timer
interrupt maintains the system clocks.
