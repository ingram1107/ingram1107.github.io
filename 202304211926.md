# System Design Specification

System design specification is a document presenting the complete design for the
new information system alongside with detailed costs, staffing, and scheduling
for completing the system implementation. By convention, it has the following
sections:
- management summary: briefly overviews the [Project](202303251004.md), outlines
  the development efforts to data, provides a current status report, summarises
  project costs, reviews new system's benefits, presents implementation
  schedule, and highlight any issues needed to be addressed by management
- system components: contains the new system's complete design, includes all
  relevant documentation and [Requirements](202303251303.md) between the package
  and the system
- system environment: describes the [constraints](202303250956.md) affecting the
  system
- implementation requirements: specifies start-up processing, initial data entry
  or acquisition, user training requirements, and [software test plan](202206201159.md)
- time and cost estimates: provides detailed schedules, cost estimates, and
  staffing requirements for system development, and revises projections for the
  rest of the [SDLC](202303251030.md) including project's total costs-to-date
  and compare those costs with prior estimates
- additional material: other material that is helpful to the readers
