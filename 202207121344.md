# Predicate

Predicate is the part of the sentence from which the subject has been removed. Let's see the sentence, *James is a student at MMU*. In linguistics, *James* is the subject, *is a student at MMU* is the Predicate.

In [202204281244](202204281244.md)#, however, Predicate (sometime called *propositional function* or *open sentence*) is a sentence that contains a finite number of variables and becomes a statement when specific values are substituted for the variables. Let $P$ be *is a student at MMU* and $Q$ be *is a student*. Both $P$ and $Q$ are what we called the **predicate symbols**. If say the sentences are *$x$ is a student at MMU* *$x$ is a student at $y$* ($x$ and $y$ are **predicate variables**), then it is equivalent to express it in mathematical term $P(x)$ and $Q(x, y)$ respectively.

If $P(x)$ is a predicate and $x$ has domain $D$, then the [truth set](202205061151.md) of $P(x)$, denoted $\{ x \in D | P(x) \}$, is the set of all elements of $D$ that make $P(x)$ true when they are substituted for $x$.
