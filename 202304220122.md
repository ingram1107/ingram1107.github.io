# Piconet

Piconet is one of the [Bluetooth](202304212236.md) network topologies where hive
connects up to 7 simultaneous or 200+ inactive or parked drone per piconet.
Other than parked state, the drone could be in standby when it doesn't
participate in the piconet. Piconet has a maximum capacity of 1 Mbps and a
unique hopping pattern or ID. The hive sets the hopping pattern for the pattern
where the rest of the drones must follow. All devices in a piconet will hop
together (?).

Before forming a piconet, there is no synchronisation happening as all devices
are in standby mode. When a device established a piconet, it automatically
becomes the hive which sends an inquiry to discover other devices for
connection. After a drone connected to the hive, it assigns drone's clock
(determines its phase in hopping pattern) and device ID (48-bit, determines its
hopping pattern).

Active drones have a 3-bit active member address (AMA), parked drones have an
8-bit parked member address (PMA), and standby drones don't have an address.
