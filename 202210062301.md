# Process

Process is an instance of a #[Program](202210062258.md) that is being executed.
`fork` [System Call](202210062303.md)# could be used to create a new Process.
The process will inherit all the environment variables from the parent process.
In #c, this could be accessed via function `getenv()`, which will either return
a pointer to the specified environment variable or a NULL pointer, or third
argument to the main function (shown below). The latter will be terminated with
a NULL pointer.

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[]) {
  ...
}
```

It has the following structure, from top to bottom:
1. stack (where the function call's address linkage and data elements)
2. heap (for dynamic memory allocation)
3. uninitialised data
4. initialised read-write data
5. initialised read-only data
6. text (contain machine instructions)

**Note**: In most cases, there will be a space between heap and stack in order
to accommodate the growth of these two portions.

Every process has its own unique process ID (PID), which could be obtained via
`getid()` [System Call](202210062303.md)#. We could get its parent's PID too
using `getppid()`. The process will inherit the user ID and group ID, which
could be inspected with `getuid()` and `getgid()` or `geteuid()` and `getegid()`
(getting the effective user ID and group ID, usually is the same with the user
ID and group ID).
