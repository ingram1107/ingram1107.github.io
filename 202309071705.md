# Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

HMM is a [Markov Model](202309071659.md) with the states of model hidden from
the observation. Instead, we can only guess the state via the observation of the
emission of outputs. There are three primary variables is of our concern, which
are the **state-transition probability matrix**, **emission or state conditional
output probability matrix**, and **initial or previous state probability
matrix**. We thus get the following formula:

$$
P(q_1, \ldots, q_t | o_1, \ldots, o_t) \times \prod_{i=1}^t P(o_i | q_i)
\prod_{i=1}^t P(q_i | q_{i-1})
$$

Where:
- $q$ and $o$ denotes the state and output respectively
- $P(q_i)$ denotes the initial state probabilities
- $P(q_i|q_i-1)$ denotes the state-transition probabilities
- $P(o_i|q_i)$ denotes the emission probabilities

The emission probabilities may be in discrete or continuous form. For the
former, it should be modelled using pmfs, the latter using pdfs.

Though the formula looks complicated, it should be easy to understand given an
example. What we have to do is to find the corresponding probabilities (initial
and the following) from the matrices and find their total production, in order
to know how possible such combination of sequential data will present. In short,
we are just finding the joint probability of a certain sequence.

HMM has widespread application in [Bioinformatics](202308152050.md), such as
sequence comparison, gene finding, fold assignment and structure prediction, and
[Phylogeny](202308152048.md) and function prediction.
