# Project Estimation

[Software project](202303251004.md) estimation may be a series of steps that
provide estimates with acceptable risks, meaning we have to accept some degree
of uncertainty. It could take several approaches like:
- Delay estimation until late in the project (not practical as estimation has to
  be provided up-front)
- Base estimates on similar projects (work well if project influences including
  customer, business conditions, deadlines etc. are roughly equivalent, but even
  by that, they might have vastly different environmental factors that could
  affect the estimation accuracy)
- Use relatively simple [Decomposition Techniques](202305140747.md)
  (divide-and-conquer)
- Use one or more empirical models (a model is based on experience like
  historical data and takes the form $d = f(v_i)$, where $d$ is one of a number
  of estimated values and $v_i$ is the selected independent parameters can
  complement decomposition techniques) like [Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO II)](202305140821.md)
