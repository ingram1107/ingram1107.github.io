# Speculative Load

Speculative load stores value preemptively to a register. This is especially
useful when out-of-order (OOO) execution is not possible when there is data
dependency and/or the instruction can't be decoded fast enough. It is
essentially the same as [Hardware Prefetching](202403210909.md).
