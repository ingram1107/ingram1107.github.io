# Block Cipher

Block Cipher processes messages (plaintext) into blocks, and then encrypt or
decrypt them one by block. It usually requires equal or larger than 64 bits.
However, in practise, it might be used to encrypt or decrypt arbitrary size of
data blocks or stream, therefore defined in ANSI x3.106-1983 modes of use (FIPS
81), there are 4 possible modes for Block Cipher to use including block and
stream modes. For block mode of operation, it may need to use
[message padding](202210072122.md)# for short block (usually the last block).

Most Block Ciphers are based on [Feistel Cipher Structure](202210052211.md). And
instead of encrypting the entire block which could be costly, the encrypted
block is assembled from smaller one utilising [Product Cipher](202211062205.md).

Examples of Block Cipher are:
- All variants of [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)#
- [International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)](202210061123.md)#
- [Blowfish](202210061124.md)#
- [RC5](202210061125.md)#
- [Cast-128](202210061129.md)#
