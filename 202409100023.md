# Data Analytics

Data analytics allows organisations to better comprehend the impact of their
products and services, adjust their methods and goals, and provide their
customers with better products faster. The value may come from **transactional
information** or **analytical information**. The former is captured and
processed as events happen, which is used to analyse daily sales reports and
production schedules to determine how much inventory to carry. The latter
supports managerial analysis tasks.

**Note**: Data may be structured or unstructured.
