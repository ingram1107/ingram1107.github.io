# GPRS Mobility Management (GMM)

GMM is the process of registration of the mobile into the [General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)](202304111940.md)
network which occurs when the [Mobile Station](202305162139.md) is first powered
on and can occur later based on network settings. There are three states that a
mobile station can be in: **IDLE**, **READY**, and **STANDBY**.

In IDLE state, the mobile station is powered on but not attached to GPRS, thus
is not reachable. The mobile station enters the READY state upon attaching
itself to GPRS network by informing the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) its
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) from SIM card or
Packet-Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI), and falls back to the IDLE
state when GPRS detach is initiated. When it enters the READY state, the mobile
station engages in packet transfer or terminates a packet transfer. This state
is determined by a [Timer](202404061106.md), and no paging needed in this state.
The mobile station will enter the STANDBY when the READY timer expires, meaning
no packets are sent for a long period. In STANDBY mode, it is powered on and
attached to GPRS. There is no packet transfer in the progress, and routing area
update are sent on demand.
