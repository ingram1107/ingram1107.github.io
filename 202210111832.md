# Twisted Pair Cable

Twisted Pair Cable is a #[Metallic Cable](202210111820.md) that has twisted
pairs of insulated cables wrapped in a protective shield where each pair
constitutes a single communication link. It is twisted in order to reduce the
electrical interference. Despite the effort, it is more prone to interference
comparing to [Coaxial Cable](202302161846.md).

Depending on the arrangement of pins on connecting to the end device, Twisted
Pair Cable could be categorised into:
- [Straight-Through Cable](202210111828.md)#
- [Crossover Cable](202210111835.md)#
- [Roll-Over Cable](202210111839.md)#

Furthermore, it could be grouped by whether it is shielded or not:
- [Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP)](202210111822.md)#
- [Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP)](202210111826.md)#
