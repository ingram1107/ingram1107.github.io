# Direct Manipulation

 Coined by Shneiderman in 1983, direct manipulation enables the user to feel
 that they are directly controlling the digital objects as they're mimicking how
 physical objects are manipulated. A workable direct manipulation should have
 *continuous representation* of objects and actions of interest, *physical
 actions and button pressing*, and *rapid reversible actions with immediate
 feedback* on object of interest. This comes with several advantages targeted at
 different audience: for novice, basic functionality can be quickly learned and
 understood; for experienced user, they can carry out wide range of tasks
 rapidly and even define new functions from it; for intermittent user (not often
 use the system), they can retain the operational concept over time. Error
 messages rarely needed as the user can immediately see the result of their
 actions, thus [experience](202303242126.md) less anxiety and gains more
 confidence (feel in control). However, such [metaphor](202304161003.md) can be
 taken too literally, and not all tasks and actions can be described by objects
 and done directly. Tedious tasks such as spell checking are better achieved
 through [Delegation](202302051232.md). Moreover, there is an inferiority of
 mouse interaction compare to [keyboard shortcuts](202304161025.md).
