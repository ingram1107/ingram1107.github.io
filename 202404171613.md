# Telephone Routing over IP (TRIP)

TRIP is a [Protocol](202209302229.md) proposed by [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md)
intended to locate a user in an integrated network. TRIP divides the world into
a set of [IP telephone](202302201418.md) administrative domains (`itads`).

A [location server](202302201856.md) or other network element can use TRIP to
advertise routes. Two location servers could utilise this feature to inform each
other about external routes that they know.
