# IPv6 Address

IPv6 Address is a 128-bit #[IP Address](202206281021.md) intended to replace the
existing #[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md). It is possible to give every user on
the Earth multiple global IP addresses without worrying the eventuality of
running out of them. This allows true peer-to-peer networking among hosts. IPv6
protocol is defined in RFC 2460.

The notation for IPv6 Address is quite simple. There is no
[Address Classes](202206280922.md) for it. It is divided into *8 fields* of *16
bits* in Hex. The first *64-bit* is for the network ID, and the rest *64-bit* is
for the host ID. Network ID is further segmented into *prefix* chunks. A typical
example of it is like this:

2a03:2880:f12a:0083:face:0000:0000:25de

The leading zeros can be omitted, just as the following:

2a03:2880:f12a:83:face:0:0:25de

If there is a successive field of 0, we can abbreviate it using `::`:

2a03:2880:f12a:83:face::25de

**Note**: The shorthand `::` can be only used once to prevent ambiguity.

**Note**: `::` can be used at the beginning or the end of the IPv6 address
space.

Addresses that start with the prefix `fe80::/10` are **link-local** addresses
which is used within a network. `fe00/12`-prefix addresses are used for
multicasting. Unique local addresses have a prefix of `fc00::/7` which provides
private addresses within a IPv6 network similar to that of
[NAT](202206281817.md) in IPv4. These properties allow IPv6 hosts to initiate
**unicast**, **multicast**, and **anycast** (to any one of a group of hosts)
communication. Further discussion on addressing architecture is put on RFC 2373.

IPv6 provides an *easy address autoconfiguration* that is similar to of
[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](202206151645.md),
[Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)](202302200938.md) which provides
*easier address management and delegation*. The advantage of using it compare to
its IPv4 counterpart is that it doesn't require a specialised application or
server when providing addresses to simple network devices such as robotic arms
in a factory. Furthermore, it doesn't have the support for fragmentation and IP
options unlike in [IPv4](202206151453.md).

To prevent address duplication, IPv6 has a built-in feature of *Duplicate
Address Detection (DAD)*. This is especially useful when dealing with the
problem in stateless autoconfiguration or DHCPv6.

Furthermore, IPv6 has *embedded support for [IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)#*
(IP Security, a protocol for IP encryption). Host #operating-system can
configure their own IPsec tunnel to other IPv6 host on-demand without needing
help from the network unlike in IPv4. It enhances security of the connection and
autonomy of the host in the network. Such support is also extended to Mobile
IPv6 (MIPv6).

The integrity checking of IPv6 is done by checksum and High-Level Data Link
Control protocol (HDLC, which operate at [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)).

IPv6 protocol has a 40-byte fix-length header. Like in [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md),
there is a field, that is the 8-bit traffic field, that provides
[QoS](202209282057.md) service (in IPv4, it's TOS). There is no fragmentation
and reassembly at intermediate routers, which means that the packets that are
too large will be simply dropped from the traffic and resend with smaller
datagram size. Plus, there is no header checksum for IPv6 header.

Other benefits of using IPv6 over IPv4 including:
- *optimised routing* (without [Network Address Translation (NAT)](202206281817.md)#
  and [Port Address Translation (PAT)](202206281830.md)#)
