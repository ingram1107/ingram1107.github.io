# B-Tree

B-Tree of order M is a #[202112101956](202112101956.md) that has the following
[Characteristics](#characteristics).

B-Tree could be used in:
- database system

## Characteristics

- Root node is either a leaf or has between 2 and M children
- Non-leaf nodes, except root, has between M/2 and M children
- All leaves share the same depth

## Details

- Leaves are used to store data
- Keys stored in the left leaves is smaller than the keys stored in the right
  leaves
- If the leaf is full, it will split the parent node into two

## Analysis

- The depth of the B-Tree is at most $\lceil \log_{\lceil \frac{M}{2} \rceil} N \rceil$
- Find operation will result in $O(\log N)$
- Insertion and Deletion will result in $O(M \log_M N)$
- The best choice of M is either 3 or 4
- B-Tree will be 69% full
