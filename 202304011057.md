# Requirement Documentation

There are two types of requirement documentation:
- [User Requirements Specification (URS)](202304011059.md)
- [System Requirements Specification (SRS)](202304011103.md)

However, these documentations only describe the end product. To manage the
[Requirement](202303251303.md) in a more organised way, requirement management
tools could be used to store requirements in a structured repository.
