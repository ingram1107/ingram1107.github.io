# Security Mechanism

Security Mechanism is a mechanism that detects, prevents or recovers from
[Security Attack](202209261358.md)#. Most mechanism utilises #cryptography.
Based on whether it is general or specific to the
[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md)# layers, Security
Mechanism could be categorised into the following two groups:
- [Specific Security Mechanism](202210040919.md)#
- [Pervasive Security Mechanism](202210040932.md)#

There are several examples of Security Mechanism including:
- [Encryption/Encipherment](202209281121.md)#
- Software Controls (#database or #operating-system)
- Hardware Controls (smart card)
- Security Policies
- Physical Controls
- Secure Communication Channel
- [Digital Signature](202210040909.md)#
- [Access Control](202210022203.md)#
- [Data Integrity](202210040913.md)#
- [Authentication Exchange](202210040915.md)
- [Traffic Padding](202210040916.md)#
- [Routing Control](202210040917.md)#
- [Notarisation](202210040918.md)#
- [Trusted Functionality](202210040924.md)#
- [Security Label](202210040926.md)#
- [Event Detection](202210040927.md)#
- [Security Audit Trail](202210040928.md)#
- [Security Recovery](202210040930.md)#
