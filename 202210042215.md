# Information Source

Information Source is an object that produces a symbol or an event, where the
outcome is random and is subjected to some probability distribution. In
[Communication System](202210042126.md)#, it is a device that produces messages
in either analogue or digital form. In addition, analogue sources could be
transformed into [discrete form](202210042219.md)# by *sampling and quantisation
techniques*.

It can be classified as either:
- A source with memory (current symbol depends on the previous symbols, or
- [Memoryless Source](202209291056.md)#

When said information source ($S$) is a $n$-oder extension of itself, this means
that it is $S^n$, and it will produce [Block Code](202210290914.md)# of size
$n$. The total number of block codes produced will be $K^n$ where $K$ is the
number of individual symbols. Getting the probabilities for each block is as
easy as multiplies each individual symbol's probability. See details on
[Entropy](202209291005.md)# on how to calculate its uncertainty.
