# Interrupt Only System

Interrupt only [System](202303242148.md) implements interrupts that can occur at
[fixed rates](202404141449.md), [aperiodically](202404141450.md), or
[both](202404141451.md). It is easy to write and has fast response times
([Hardware Scheduling](202404141538.md)). Despite these, it has several
limitations including inefficiency of jump-to-self loop, difficulty of providing
advanced services (device drivers and interfaces to multiple layered networks),
vulnerability to malfunctions (timing variations, [Race Condition](202112061109.md),
and #hardware failure).
