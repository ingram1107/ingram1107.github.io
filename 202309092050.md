# Chou-Fasman Method

Chou-Fasman method is a statistical [predictino method](202309092041.md) over a
number of protein tertiary structure and determined the frequency of each [Amino Acid](202308082207.md)
type in each state. It is the simplest method to use due to its single residual
method. However, the rules, explained below, are qualitative instead of
quantitative, and it doesn't consider neighbouring amino acid for predictions.
It can only achieve 50% to 60% accuracy.

According to the method, we have to form a **nucleation** which can be predicted
when *4 of 6 sequential residues* in certain segment tend to form helix or *3 of
5 for sheet*. The nucleation regions are extended along both directions of the
sequence until average 4-peptides propensities drops below 1, and it will be
terminated. If any extended segment with average propensities
$\left<P_\alpha\right> > 1.03$ and $\left<P_\alpha\right> >
\left<P_\beta\right>$, it can be predicted as helix. If $\left<P_\beta\right> >
1.05$ and $\left<P_\beta\right> > \left<P_\alpha\right>$, then it can be
predicted as sheet. If both helix and sheet are predicted in certain region,
then the secondary structure conformation with higher average propensities is
predicted. A turn is predicted only if the turn probability is greater than the
helix or sheet probabilities and is calculated using a multistep procedure.
