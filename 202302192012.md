# Inheritance in C

While it is generally advised to adopt [C++](202302190651.md) if there is a need
of inheritance, it is possible to implement such feature in [C](202302190647.md)
`struct` and utilising the fact that the first item in a `stuct` is offset of
zero. We can implement inheritance in C by including the parent `struct` as the
first element for the child `struct`:

```c
typedef enum { ST_INT, ST_FLOAT, ST_COUNT } StructType;

typedef struct {
  char name[32];
  StructType type;
} Parent;

typedef struct {
  Parent head;
  int value;
} ChildInt;

typedef struct {
  Parent head;
  float value;
} ChildFloat;
```

Later, we can have polymorphism by inspecting the value of `type` to determine
which child `struct` is the target:

```c
void set_value(Parent *h, double value)
{
  if (h->type == ST_INT) {
    ((ChildInt *)h)->value = (int) value;
  } else {
    ((ChildFloat *)h)->value = (float) value; // this will be executed
  }
}

ChildFloat* myobj = malloc(...);
set_value((Parent *) myobj, ...);
```
