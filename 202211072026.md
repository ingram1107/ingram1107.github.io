# Indistinguishability Against Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA)

IND-CCA is the highest security notion for an [encryption scheme](202209281121.md)#.
It is resistant to the most lenient [Cryptanalytic Attack](202209281257.md)#,
that is to distinguish two ciphertexts using chosen ciphertext attack.
