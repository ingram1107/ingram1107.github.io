# Cisco Group Management Protocol (CGMP)

CGMP is a Cisco proprietary protocol based on [IGMP snooping](202209271135.md)
that allows Cisco Catalysts [Switches](202207051907.md) to make [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)
forwarding decisions based on the packet's IGMP information. By that, the switch
will not blindly forwards all multicast traffic, and instead delivers them only
to the ports where the interested receivers reside on. Any
[Router](202207061800.md) receiving a [multicast](202302201639.md) join message
via a switch replies to the switch with a CGMP join message.
