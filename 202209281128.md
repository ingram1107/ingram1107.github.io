# Cryptanalysis

Cryptanalysis is a study of principles or method of decrypting
[ciphertext](202209281121.md)# *without knowing the key*. People who study or
practise cryptanalysis are known as cryptanalyst, intruder, or attacker. The
results of a Cryptanalysis doesn't necessary bad, as they are useful feedbacks
to the cryptographers to improve their #algorithm.

There are two general approaches on how to decrypt the ciphertext without the
key:
- [Cryptanalytic Attack](202209281257.md)#
- [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md)#
