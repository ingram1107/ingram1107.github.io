# Fibre-Channel

Fibre-Channel is a [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md) protocol that provides
high-speed data transfer. It usually operates at 1 to 4 Gbps, but 8-Gbps and
10-Gbps are possible too. It is often used by [SANs](202302131553.md) for
accessing.

For deployment, the following topologies could be considered:
- *Point-to-point*
- *Arbitrated loop* which is closed up to 126 nodes (maximum bandwidth is 100
  MB)
- *Switch fabric* (100 Mbps) to each [switched](202207051907.md) port
  ([VLAN Trunking](202212251342.md) is allowed)
