# Random Early Discard (RED)

RED, or Random Early Detection, is a proactive [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
where the [Router](202207061800.md) discards packets before the [buffer overflow](202209302245.md)
by computing the average queue length each time a packet arrives. If the average
is greater than some upper threshold, it assumes a serious [Network Congestion](202209302043.md)
and packet discarding is performed. If the average is between the lower
threshold and upper threshold, it may indicate a mild congestion, further
congestion probability have to be calculated. If the average is lower than some
lower threshold, then the packet can be queued.
