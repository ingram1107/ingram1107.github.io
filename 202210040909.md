# Digital Signature

Digital Signature is a #[Security Mechanism](202209261402.md) where
[hashed](202112122038.md)# data is appended to (sometimes
[encrypted](202209281121.md)# using [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)#)
a data unit, allowing a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and
[Integrity](202210022154.md)# of the data unit. It can [authenticate](202210022151.md)
the data origin by verifying author, date, and time of signature. Furthermore, it
could protect against forgery due to its [Non-Repudiation](202210022159.md)#
nature. At the receiver side, it will either reject (return value 0) or accept
(return value 1) the signature.

**Note**: Hashing is used to avoid certain [attacks](202209281257.md) as Digital
Signature alone doesn't protect the [Confidentiality](202210022150.md) of the
message.

It is using an [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md)# approach for signing
$S = [H(M)]^d \mod n$ (using sender's private key) and verifying $H(M) = S^e
\mod n$ (using receiver's public key), thus is universally verifiable.

**Note**: As you can see, it generally signs the digest instead of the whole
message.

Most Digital Signature models deploy **sign first then encrypt** policy in order
to prevent possible signature forgery and the ease of verification by third
party. The second point is based on the fact the signature is generated based on
the encrypted message, then the third party will need to have access to the
decryption key in order to view the inner content. Several implementations could
be considered to deploy Digital Signature:
- [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)
- [El Gamal Encryption](202212102116.md)
- [Digital Signature Standard (DSS)](202302061427.md)

The RSA model of Digital Signature could be attacked using
[existential forgery using key only attack](202302052024.md) by selecting $S$
randomly to compute $M = S^e \mod n$. Moreover, an existential forgery using a
known message attack could be conducted aiming at the multiplicative properties
of RSA by computing $S_1 S_2 \mod n$ as $(M_1 M_2)^d \mod n = (M_1)^d (M_2)^d
\mod n = S_1 S_2 \mod n$. Another selective forgery using chosen message attack
could be performed at RSA model by randomly generate a secret $r$ to compute $M'
= Mr^e \mod n$ and submit it as the chosen message. See more detail in
[Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md). All of these attacks could be
prevented by adopting a secure [Hash Function](202112122038.md) (See
[Full Domain Hash RSA (FDH-RSA) Signature](202302061423.md)).

**Note**: Most of the computation are the same in El Gamal Digital Signature
when compare to the encryption scheme. However, the other element in the pair
(the ciphertext pair in the original scheme), $c_2$ or $b$, should be computed
using the formula $b = k^{-1} (M - x \cdot a) \mod (p - 1)$. The verification
could be done by checking whether $y^a \cdot a^b = g^M \mod p$.

There are three concerns needed to be addressed in Digital Signature model, that
is **key generation** (public key and private key), **signing** (outputting
signature given the input and private key), and **verification** (verify the
message-signature pair given the pair and the public key). Several requirements
need to be tackled that the Digital Signature:
- must depend on the message signed
- must use information unique to the sender to prevent forgery and denial
  ([Non-Repudiation](202210022159.md))
- must be relatively easy to produce/compute
- must be relatively easy to recognise and verify
- be [computational secure](202209281245.md) that it is infeasible to forge new
  message or Digital Signature
- practical to be stored
