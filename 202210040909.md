# Digital Signature

Digital Signature is a #[Security Mechanism](202209261402.md) where data is
appended to (sometimes [encrypted](202209281121.md)#) a data unit, allowing a
recipient of the data unit to prove the source and [Integrity](202210022154.md)#
of the data unit. It could protect against forgery. At the receiver side, it
will either reject (return value 0) or accept (return value 1) the signature.

It is using an [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md)# approach for signing
and verifying, thus is universally verifiable.
