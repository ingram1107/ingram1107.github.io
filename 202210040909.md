# Digital Signature

Digital Signature is a #[Security Mechanism](202209261402.md) where
[hashed](202112122038.md)# data is appended to (sometimes
[encrypted](202209281121.md)# using [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)#)
a data unit, allowing a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and
[Integrity](202210022154.md)# of the data unit. It could protect against
[forgery](202210022151.md)# due to its [Non-Repudiation](202210022159.md)#
nature. At the receiver side, it will either reject (return value 0) or accept
(return value 1) the signature.

**Note**: Hashing is used to avoid certain [attacks](202209281257.md).

It is using an [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md)# approach for signing
$S = [H(M)]^d \mod n$ (using sender's private key) and verifying $H(M) = S^e
\mod n$ (using receiver's public key), thus is universally verifiable.
