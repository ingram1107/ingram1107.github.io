# Automation Controller

Automation Controller is part of the #[202204292323](202204292323.md). It is a
self-hosted (on-premise or [cloud](202210012158.md)#) Web UI and REST API
(accessible via url `api/v2`) running on [202205251159](202205251159.md) or
OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

It provides role-based access control (RBAC), push-button deployment, centrally
logged facility for all automation, and powerful workflows. Typically, it is
used by DevOps in order to monitor the state of the
[automation](202204272021.md)#.

The basic unit for Automaton Controller is Automation Job. It consists of
*project* (collection of [202204272036](202204272036.md)# with [202208131616](202208131616.md)# or within the Automation
Controller instance), *credential* such as CyberArk and Vault and
[202204272043](202204272043.md)# which composed of [202206151453](202206151453.md)#, username, and access method
([202205251209](202205251209.md), [202205191908](202205191908.md), API). Automation Job could be defined in a
Job Template.

We can put up a survey for end user to configure [202205042134](202205042134.md)# values for
the Job.

**Note**: It is a common practice to avoid defining host or group in the
[202204272036](202204272036.md)# within Automation Controller since the *inventory* already had
it covered.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Automation Controller uses a user management system which allow role-based
[Access Control](202210022203.md)#. The user management involves of three entities: organisation,
user, and teams. Organisation is a collection of entities including users,
teams, projects, and inventories. User is the basic unit in the user management
system. A team can include several users, projects, credentials and permission.
The permission granted to the team will be granted to all members in that team.

Users can be grouped into 3 different teams, and roles can be assigned according
to those teams. The rights or capabilities can be assigned across all objects.
These could be backed by enterprise authentication.

This can be done by clicking the Access tab in the job template which you can
assign users and/or role to the job. In this way, that particular job will be
visible to the user or those who are assigned to the role.

## Workflow

Workflow merges multiple automation jobs into a single visual representation. It
allows job chaining by using basic logic indicated as coloured line. The lines
can be in three colours: blue, green and red. A blue line shows that the job
will run regardless of the status of the previously executed job. Green line
verifies that the job will run if the previous job exit on success. Red line,
however, displays that the job will run if the previous job fail. The jobs don't
necessarily need to be run in a sequence, they can be run in parallel.

**Note**: You can embed a workflow in a workflow even if the workflow selected
is itself.

One could schedule the workflow in the Automation Controller, or use API to
activate a workflow.
