# Compound Statement

Compound statement is a #[202204281244](202204281244.md) that consists of at least one
[primitive logical operator](202205062025.md)#. It expresses the relationship
between different statements or the statement itself. For example: "is not $p$",
"$p$ and $q$", "$p$ or $q$ or both" and "$p$ or $q$ but not both".

To express "is not $p$", we could denote it mathematically as $\sim p$ or $\neg
p$. This is called **negation** where we negate the statement itself. The truth
value of a negation is the opposite truth value of the statement that it
negated.

"$p$ and $q$" can be expressed in terms of mathematic as $p \land q$. The
**conjunction** is true, if and only if both statements are true.

There are two kinds of or, an inclusive one and another exclusive, both are
**disjunction**. The statement "$p$ or $q$ or both" uses inclusive or, where
either $p$, $q$ or both are true, then the statement is true. It is denoted $p
\lor q$. "$p$ or $q$ but not both" uses in a more restrictive or where having
both is not desirable. This could be express by only using $\sim$, $\land$ and
$\lor$: $(p \lor q) \land \sim (p \land q)$. It can shorten as $p \oplus q$ to
represent an exclusive or.

Their relationship could be expressed in [202205061151](202205061151.md)#.
