# Git Notes

`notes` is a #[202205251209](202205251209.md) command that add, removes or reads notes attached
to the commits. This can become handy if you want to have a release notes
separated from the commit history (this has been deprecated by GitHub).

To add note, use the command `add {commit}`. To remove notes, use the command
`remove {commit...}` on either single commit or multiple commits. Showing note
can be done by the command `show {commit}`. If the commit is omitted, `notes`
will referring to the current commit by default.
