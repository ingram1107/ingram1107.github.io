# Necessary and Sufficient Condition

There are two types of conditions: *Necessary* and *Sufficient*.

Necessary Condition is a condition where one [202204281244](202204281244.md) solely depends on
another statement. This could be expressed in [202205062055](202205062055.md)# as "if not $r$,
then not $s$". "If $s$ then $r$" means the same thing.

Sufficient Condition is a condition where one statement is sufficient to
guarantee the occurrence of another statement. When expressed in conditional
statement, this means that "if $r$ then $s$".

If a condition is **both** necessary and sufficient, this implies
[biconditional statement](202205062055.md)#. The statement "$r$ if, and only if
$s$" expresses such condition.
