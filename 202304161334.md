# Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS is a model of #software development where a service is hosted as a service
provided to the clients over the Internet by the [cloud vendor](202210012158.md).
In this way, the user will not own the software licence, and instead billed for
the service based on their usage. Examples of SaaS are Google Drive, Slack,
Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Print, Microsoft SharePoint, and Sales Cloud
(from Salesforce).
