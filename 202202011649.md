# Differences between Parallelism and Concurrency

Let's imagine two examples:
1. You are dining with a traditional Chinese family.
2. You are dining with a Western family.

In a typical Chinese family, we share dishes such as vegetables, porks, soup
etc. in the same table. Even though we happen to hold our own chopsticks and
rice, we do share the same dishes. This is call [202202011815](202202011815.md)#.

In contrast, the western family have their ingredients pack into one meal for
everyone around the table. Assume that all of you drink mineral water. There is
no need to share anything. This is call *parallelism*.
