# Key Distribution

There are various ways of distributing the keys in
#[Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md) scheme:
1. physical delivery
2. [third party](202210062220.md)# involvement on key selection and distribution
3. distribute key in a format encrypted with previous key
4. If there are secure communications with a [third party](202210062220.md)# on
   both sides, then the third party could relay the key between them
5. [use public key](202203221212.md)#

Using the method 2 and 3, *session key* and *master key* are necessary to verify
and secure the Key Distribution from possible [intruder](202209281128.md).
Session key is a temporary key used for encryption of data between users. It
will be discarded once the session is over, hence the name. Master key is a key
that is used to encrypt the session key, which is shared by the users and
