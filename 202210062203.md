# Symmetric Key Distribution

There are various ways of distributing the keys in
#[Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md) scheme:
1. physical delivery
2. [third party](202210062220.md)# involvement on key selection and distribution
3. distribute key in a format encrypted with previous key
4. If there are secure communications with a [third party](202210062220.md)# on
   both sides, then the third party could relay the key between them
5. [use public key](202203221212.md)#

Using the method 2 and 3, [Session Key](202302062029.md) and
[Master Key](202302062030.md) are necessary to verify and secure the Key
Distribution from possible [intruder](202209281128.md).

Key distribution could be done automatically, but there is a need of trusting
the distribution system. Another alternative is decentralised key distribution
which utilises delegation.
