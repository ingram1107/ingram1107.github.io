# Discount Factor

Discount factor is a representation of money value depletion. The following
shows the calculation of discount factor $f$:

$$
f^t = \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

Where:
- $r$ is the discount rate, which is subjective and based on the interest in
  other similar risk investments.
- $t$ is the year.
