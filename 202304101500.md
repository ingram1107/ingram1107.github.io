# Coherent/Directed Beam Infrared

Coherent/Directed beam infrared is generated by a laser diode (LD) for short
line-of-sight [connections](202304061144.md). Of course, the light beam must be
focused or directly point to the receiver which is unsuitable in
[mobile equipment application](202303292147.md).
