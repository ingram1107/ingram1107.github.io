# Amazon S3 Glacier

Glacier is an [S3 storage class](202312132008.md) that focuses on high security
and durability in extremely low cost, sacrificing IO performance. Glacier Deep
Archive provides even higher durability in the cost of IO
[Throughput](202304111957.md). Glacier allows a size of 40 TB for a single
object.

Archive is the base unit of storage in Glacier which describes any object store
in it. Each archive has their own unique ID. A vault is a container for storing
archives, associates with [region which it resides](202312011406.md). Each vault
has one **vault access policy** and one **vault lock policy** that are attached
to it.

There are three options for data retrieval policy for S3 Glacier: expedited (1
to 5 minutes), standard (3 to 5 hours), and bulk (5 to 12 hours). Of course the
expedited option has the highest price and bulk has the lowest price on GB per
volume metric.

The difference to other non-Glacier S3 storage classes in Amazon pricing policy
is that it is only charged on UPLOAD and retrieval requests. However, it is more
expensive to do so, in the metrics of per request and per GB.
