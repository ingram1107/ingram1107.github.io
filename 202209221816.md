# LAN Emulation (LANE)

LANE is a standard defined for [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)#
in order to allow [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md)# traffic within
the ATM network initiated by ATM end stations. It composed of two main
components: **LAN emulation clients (LEC)** and **LAN emulation servers (LES)**.
They play an important role on forwarding and control, trying to emulate LAN
within the network. One advantage of using LANE is that it doesn't require
modification from higher layer, thus making it transparent to the application's
use.
