# Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC)

SVC is one of two types of #[Virtual Circuit](202208301234.md) that provides
temporary connection. It is typically used for irregular data transfer between
data terminal equipments (DTE) across #[the network](202207150848.md). It has 4
operational states: *Call Setup*, *Data Transfer*, *Idle* and *Call
Termination*.

If SVC is Idle for some predetermined amount of time, it will automatically
terminate itself. A call is required if there is in need of data flow. Thus, it
often produced undesired overhead when compare to [its counterpart](202208301245.md).
