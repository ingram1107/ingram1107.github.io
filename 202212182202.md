# Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)

DTP is a Cisco proprietary Point-to-Point [Protocol](202209302229.md)# used
between [Switches](202207051907.md)# for automatic [trunk](202212251342.md)#
negotiation. Depending on modes set on both end, DTP can decide whether the
link should be trunk or non-trunk. The following table shows the outcome for the
link for different composition of opposite ports.
