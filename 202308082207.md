# Amino Acid

Amino acid is the monomer unit or foundation of protein. Protein performs
different biological activities and is responsible for an individual's traits
such as eye colour, body height etc. It could be [folded](202308091333.md) into
different structures (**primary**, **[secondary](202309092041.md)**,
**tertiary**, and **quaternary**) to carry out different protein functions.
Primary structure of a protein determines its conformation. Protein structure is
more conserved than the sequence during the evolution.

**Note**: As shown in the above figure, the primary structure of protein appear
as a linear object.

We could determine the 3D protein structure via different methods such as
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, and cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM).
