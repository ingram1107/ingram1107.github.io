# Task Control Block (TCB)

TCB is a data structure kept by OS to track the status of
[processes](202210062301.md). These information may include the task identifier,
priority, status, work registers, program counter, status register(s), stack
pointer, pointer to next TCB etc. It can be used in
[Round-Robin](202404232253.md), [Pre-emptive Priority](202404141550.md), or
hybrid scheduling systems.

The OS typically kept two [Linked Lists](202110191729.md) of TCB: a linked list
of TCB from ready tasks and another linked list of TCB from suspended tasks. A
table of resources and a table of resource requests are also kept in order to
track the resource's status waited in the suspended list.
