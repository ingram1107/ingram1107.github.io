# Group

Group is a [Set](202204281446.md)# of elements $S$, together with one operation
$+$, which has the following properties:
- *Closure under addition*, which means if $a$ and $b$ belong to $S$, then $a +
  b$ is also in $S$.
- *Associativity of addition*, which means $\forall a, b, c \in S, a + (b + c) =
  (a + b) + c$.
- *Additive identity*, which means $\exist x \in R, \forall a \in S, a + x = x +
  a = a$.
- *Additive inverse*, which means $\forall a \in S, \exist -a \in S, a + (-a) =
  (-a) + a = 0$.

If the group is also commutative, then it is also an [Abelian Group](202210082309.md)#.

If every element is a power of some fixed element, such as $\exist a \in S,
\forall b \in S, b = a^k$, then the group is also a *cyclic group*. In this
cause, $a$ is also a generator of the group.
