# static

`static` is a #[202205171449](202205171449.md).

When it is defined in the *global scope*, it will make the corresponding
function or variable **invisible** from outside sources.

When it is defined in a *local scope* as a variable, it will initialise only
once, and it will exist throughout the program's lifetime. In this context, it
cannot be used together with [202205171504](202205171504.md) since C doesn't allow multiple
storage identifier for a single variable.
