# Key Reinstallation Attack (KRACK)

KRACK attack is a [Replay Attack](202209262121.md) on WiFi WPA2 by exploiting
the handshake procedure by the standard. Like replay attack, the attacker sits
in the middle of a communication session and capture the third handshake message
sent from the access point. The attacker will purposefully reluctant to send the
response to trick the access point in believing that the handshake was lost. The
access point resends the third handshake, which will restore the key and other
critical cryptographic parameters. Because WPA2 uses [Counter (CTR)](202210072049.md)
as the basis for encryption, the [Nonce](202210211901.md) could be guessed with
by [brute force](202209281259.md). The attacker can later on forge
[HMAC](202302042016.md).

**Note**: Some #operating-system such as [Linux](202204081225.md) and Android
clear the key out of the memory but nonce is still known to the attacker.
