# Interception

Interception is a form of #[Security Attack](202209261358.md) aims at
**eavesdropping or monitoring** or simply gaining access to the network flow or
the system itself. It undermines the [confidentiality](202209261050.md)# of the
system. [Traffic analysis](202210062126.md)# and
[Man-In-The-Middle Attack (MITM)](202210132201.md)# are one of the methods of
interception, and the information acquired by this method could be exposed to
the public or furthered materialised using one of the [Active Attack](202209261900.md).
