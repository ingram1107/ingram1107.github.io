# Noiseless Channel

Noiseless Channel is a #[Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC)](202210261202.md) if
it satisfies both characteristics of #[Deterministic Channel](202210261251.md)
and #[Lossless Channel](202210261248.md). It has only one non-zero element for
each row and column, which also means that the sizes for both input alphabet and
output alphabet are the same, i.e., $j-1 = k-1$.
