# P2P File Sharing with Centralised Directory

Centralised directory is maintained by a single entity, usually reside in a
large server or server farm. The client contacts the directory server for
[Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing](202303081138.md) services, in which the server
will return another peer with its [IP Address](202206281021.md) that match the
object requested by the client. In short, the directory maintains a database of
mapping of object (files) name to IP addresses. Napster established its file
sharing service with this approach.

However, with centralised directory, it is easy to have a single point of
failure as the service will become immediately unavailable once the directory
crashes. It also creates a performance bottleneck on the server side since there
might be millions of users in which the server must respond to their queries.
