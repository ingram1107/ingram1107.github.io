# E-Commerce Architecture

E-commerce architecture is a [Set](202204281446.md) of [System Architecture](202303242154.md)
which could be divided into in-house, packaged, or service-providers solution.

With the in-house solution, the organisation has complete control over site
schema, page numbers, and file sizes. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to
[integrate](202303242149.md) [web-based system](202304171942.md) with other
information systems with the benefits of cost saving and improvement on customer
service

Alternatively, packaged solution, primarily turnkey systems (project that could
be sold to anyone), from the vendors could offer the organisation a quick set-up
and operation of the e-business. However, due to its nature of generalisation,
the packaged solution might not integrate well with the organisation's internal
information system.

Other solution is to [outsource](202304161611.md) the development to service
providers. Those application service providers (ASP) offers full-scale Internet
business services to their customers.
