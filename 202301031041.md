# Statistical Anomaly Detection

Statistical Anomaly Detection collects information relating to the legitimate
users' behaviour, then use statistical tests to determine whether the new
behaviour is legitimate user behaviour or not. Two approach could be
implemented: **threshold detection** (define thresholds for the frequency of
event occurrence) and **profile based** (develop profile of activity for each
user as a reference).

Several statistics could be useful for determining anomalies such as *login
frequency by day and time*, *login frequency at different locations*, *time
since last login*, *login password failures*, *execution frequency*, *execution
denials*, *read, write, create, delete frequency*, and *failure count for read,
write, create and delete*.
