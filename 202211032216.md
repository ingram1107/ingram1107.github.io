# Convolutional Code

Convolutional Code is a continuous sequence of code. There is a **constraint
length** of a Convolutional Code, defined as the number of shifts over which a
single message bit can influence the encoder output. In a [Source Encoder](202209291038.md)
with an M-stage shift register, the constraint length is $K = M + 1$. The
encoder could be described by a set of [Generator Polynomial](202212192305.md)
where the generator sequence denotes the impulse response of the $i$th path.

In Convolutional Code, we use code tree to portray the structural properties of
its code encoder. If the input is 0, the code tree diverges upward, otherwise,
it diverges downward. The specific path in the tree is traced from *left to
right* in accordance to the input sequence. Similar to in [Cyclic Code Encoder](202212301636.md),
that is if the flip-flop is directly connected to the output, the single-bit
output is 1, otherwise it is 0, and move the bit leftward for each new input.
The calculation of the value for each path depends on the value of
[Generator Polynomial](202212192305.md) for that particular path. The new state
of the flip-flop should be recorded as the first M-bit of the message for each
round.

The ultimate aim is to find out a set of $[g_1 g_2]$ values for the input
sequence, that will be encoded as the code word. Therefore, we need to try all
possible input sequence, and calculates all possible $[g_1 g_2]$ value for each
of them. We could easily do this by constructing a **state diagram** based on
the transition between current state and the new state of the flip-flop, where
the path denotes $[g_1 g_2]$. By then, we can construct a code tree where the
divergent are denoted as the message sequence and its corresponding $[g_1 g_2]$.
Encoding can be done by traversing the code tree and get the $[g_1 g_2]$ values
from the code tree. Reverse the order of $[g_1 g_2]$ values like in [Huffman Coding](202210140846.md),
then we will get the code word for that message sequence.
