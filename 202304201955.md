# Middleware

Middleware is a component that sits between new systems and legacy systems which
translates the incompatible part of the new elements into things that the legacy
systems could understand. It offers an interface to connect software and
hardware. In short, it acts as a translator between the new systems and the
legacy systems. However, this come with the compromise on #performance since it
will produce a processing overhead over the data translation. Often times, it
[integrates](202303242149.md) the [legacy systems](202304171938.md) and
[web-based applications](202304171942.md).
