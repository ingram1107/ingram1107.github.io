# Outline Font

Outline #[202205051728](202205051728.md) is scalable, meaning that it fits to the resolution
accordingly. This could result in a worse quality when compare to
[202205051731](202205051731.md) where the pixels are fixed. In order to figure out what scale
should be used for a particular resolution, Outline Font requires more CPU time
to compute the optimal scale to display the font. For modern CPU, it does not
seem to be a problem.

There are primarily two standards for Outline Fonts: Adobe Postscript Type 1
(with extension of `.pfa` and `.pfb`) and TrueType (with extension of `.ttf`)
developed by Apple and Microsoft.
