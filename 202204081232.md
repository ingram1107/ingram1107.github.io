# Linux CPU Scheduler

Linux CPU scheduler usually defines two scheduler policies with static schedule
priority, ranging from 0 to 139. From 0 to 99, these priority values are
assigned to real-time processes which is scheduled by real-time policies where
the processes are scheduled by priority value directly. For the rest of priority
values (100 – 139), they are assigned to normal processes which is subjected to
normal schedule policies. The processes run under normal policies have lower
priority real-time processes, and if they have the same priority value with each
other, [nice value](202410041519.md) will be used to determine their execution
order. Note that the standard normal priority is set on 120.

We can review process's priority value by checking on the file
`/proc/{pid}/sched` or running program like `ps -el`, `ps -Al`, or `top`. For
`ps`, the priority value is range from -40 – 99. For `top`, it is range from
-100 – 39. Fundamentally, they are the same with the Linux underlying priority
value range.

**Note**: Lower priority value indicates higher priority.

**Note**: Process schedule tuning will affect only normal scheduled process.

For symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system, it mimics simultaneity by fast
switching between processes if the number of concurrent processes is larger than
the number of available processor units.
