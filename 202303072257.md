# SQL Injection (SQLi)

[SQL](202302231241.md) injection is an attack on [database](202302101137.md) by
injecting unexpected SQL statements to retrieve unauthorised information from
the system. It has a similar mechanism with [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](202204161849.md).

## PHP

To avoid SQLi, we can utilise the `mysqli` prepared statements to sanitise the
query input before their execution. `mysqli_prepare()` is used for statement
preparation, `mysqli_stmt_bind_param()` to bind variables' type, and
`mysqli_stmt_execute()` for prepared queries execution. See the following codes
for a brief overview:

```php
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "ingram", "hehehe", "database");

// Prepared statement
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("INSERT INTO test(id, label) VALUES (?, ?)");

// Binding variables' type
$id = 1;
$label = "PHP";
$stmt->bind_param("is", $id, $label);

// Execution
$stml->execute();
```

The meaning of `is` in the `stmt->bind_param()` is the types that should be bind
in the database correspond to the parameters given in order, that is `id`
(integer type) and `label` (string type). The table below show all possible type
values that one could use to specify the type:

| Character | Corresponding Type         |
| ---       | ---                        |
| i         | integer                    |
| d         | float                      |
| s         | string                     |
| b         | binary large object (blob) |
