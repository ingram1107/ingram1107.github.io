# Multicast Distribution Tree

Multicast distribution tree maintains the [route](202207061800.md) that IP
[multicast](202302201639.md) traffic took. Distribution tree can be
**source tree** or **shared tree**. With source tree or shortest-path tree, each
source sends its data to each receiver using the most efficient path. Though low
latency, it requires heavy memory usage. The alternative shared tree is
constructed in a common point called *rendezvous point* (RP) where the multicast
data is sent.
