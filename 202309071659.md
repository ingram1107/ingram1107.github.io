# Markov Model

Markov model is a stochastic model based on random probability distribution
which models on **temporal** ([memoryless](202209291056.md)) or **sequential**
data. It models the dependencies of the current information with the **previous
information**. It involves states, the transition schemes between them, and
emission of outputs.

The following formula shows the Markov property

$$
P(q_1, \ldots, q_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} P(q_i|q_{i-1})
$$

The model is used to learn the statistics of sequential data, do prediction or
estimation, or recognise patterns.
