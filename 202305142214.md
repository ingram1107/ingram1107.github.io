# Learnability Principles

Learnability principles focuses on the ease with which novice users can begin
effective interaction and achieve maximal performance at the same time.
Therefore, it should adhere to **predictability** ([operation visibility](202305142235.md),
can determine the effect of future actions based on past
[interaction](202303242118.md) history), **synthesisability** (assessing the
effect of past actions via immediate or eventual honesty to inform user),
**familiarity**, **generalisability** (able to applies to new situations), and
**consistency** (similar input/output behaviour from similar situations or task
objectives).

**Note**: Honesty defined here is the ability of the user interface to provide
an observable and informative change.
