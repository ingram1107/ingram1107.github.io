# Active Queue Management (AQM)

AQM is a collection of [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md) algorithms
at [Router](202207061800.md)'s input port that manage packet-dropping or
-marking policies. A typical AQM algorithm will drop the packet before the
buffer or the memory becomes full in order to send out congestion signal to the
original host.

Examples of AQM are:
