# Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA)

Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) is the simplest method
for [Phylogenetic Tree](202308142026.md) construction which is built by a
sequential clustering #algorithm that generates rooted and ultrametric trees
from distance matrix. It assumes constance rate of evolution and needs a
distance matrix calculated from a [Multiple Sequence Alignment](202308172015.md).
Two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or leaves with the smallest distance are
clustered into a *composite OTU*.

The algorithm first finds the shortest pairwise distance from distance matrix.
Then, it joins two sequences or groups with the shortest distance where the
depth of new branch is equal to half of the shortest distance. After that, it
calculates mean pairwise distances with other sequences in new matrix. Recurse
with new shortest distance until all taxa are attached.

It runs a clustering algorithm that starts with the most similar sequences
(bottom-up) while tries to minimise the total branch length of the tree.
Additional statistical data analysis can be applied using bootstrap method.

UPGMA is simple and easy to compute, at least less complex than
[NJ](202308221823.md). The trees reflect the [Phenotypic](202308152046.md)
similarities by [phylogenetic distances](202308142026.md). Furthermore, the data
can be arranged in random order prior to analysis. However, it is very sensitive
to unequal evolutionary rates, and [Data Clustering](202308212101.md) works only
if the data are ultrametric.
