# Runtime Diagnostics

It is impossible to test a deployed application in its running state by using
existing testing facilities which are aimed at building time testing. Instead,
we should implement means to the codebase in order to access the runtime state
of the program. This includes using **logging**, **hot-key sequence** (opens a
pop-up diagnostic control window) and **web server**.

For logging, we need to trace the state of the program in the form of messages.
It should be in a regular and consistent format so that it is easy to read and
parse by other programs. Information such as timestamp is great to have to know
when did the state changes.

We can deploy a web server to view internal entries and log status of the
program with GUI instead of looking into files. It makes runtime diagnostics
easier in operational terms. If possible, having a debug control panel can come
in handy.
