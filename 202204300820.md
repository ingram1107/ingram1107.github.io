# Ansible Modules

Although Ansible supports many programming languages, most of the modules are
written in Python. Majority of Windows modules are developed in PowerShell
scripts.

The [202205042134](202205042134.md)# defined within a module is call a *fact*. Run `ansible all
-m {module}` to check all the facts that has been defined in the module
specified. Since facts are variables, we could use them in #[202204272036](202204272036.md)
using the Jinja syntax `{{ }}`.
