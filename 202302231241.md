# Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL consists of [Data-Definition Language (DDL)](202302171848.md),
[Data-Manipulation Language (DML)](202302171843.md), integrity constraints, view
definition, [transaction control](202303011857.md), embedded SQL and dynamic
SQL, and [authorisation](202303012203.md). It is widely used in [relational database](202302101331.md).

The basic types for SQL are `char(n)`, `varchar(n)`, `int`, `smallint`,
`numeric(p,d)`, `real`, `double precision`, and `float(n)` where $n$ denotes the
length or the least precision of the type, $p$ denotes the precision of the
digits, and $d$ denotes the number of digits right of the decimal point. `date`,
`time`, and `timestamp` are also supported by some [database implementation](202302101137.md),
accompanied by functions such as `current_data()`, `current_time()`,
`localtime()`, `current_timestamp()`, and `localtimestamp()`. A character string
can cast into these types with the `cast {orig-type} as {date-type}`. We can
extract a field (`year`, `month`, `day`, `minute`, `second`, `timezone_hour`,
and `timezone_minute`) from date type with the syntax `extract ({field} from
{date-type})`. There is a special type called `null` that indicates an absent
value, but it is generally not recommended having such value in the
[Database](202302101139.md).

**Note**: For storing [Attributes](202304200943.md) with very large value, we
can utilise the type `clob({size})` (character large object) and `blob({size})`
(binary large object).

By SQL:1999 standard, user can create user-defined types and domain with `create
type` and `create domain`. However, it doesn't have wide adoption across other
vendors. The difference between user-defined types and domain is that the former
can't have constraints (see next paragraph), but is strongly typed (checked by
the database), and the latter can have constraints, but is not strongly typed
(value in other domain type can be assigned as long as it is compatible). For
example:

```sql
-- User-defined type
-- While the underlying storage policy is the same, the type Dollars is not the
-- same as the type Pounds
create type Dollars as numeric(12,2) final;
create type Pounds as numeric(12,2) final;

-- User-defined domain
create domain DDollars as numeric(12,2) not null;
```

To create a [table](202304191954.md) (or relation) in SQL-based database,
execute the `create table` command with the name of the table including its
desired column and their corresponding types. Optionally, integrity constraint,
such as `primary key` (unique and cannot be empty), `foreign key ... references
...` (See [referential integrity constraint](202302101331.md)), `not null`,
`unique`, and `check` clause, can be enforced on an [Attribute](202304200943.md)
(column). Other than that, we can set a default value for an attribute with
`default {value}` immediately after the attribute definition. The following SQL
codes shows such use case:

```sql
create table instructor
  (ID varchar(5),
   name varchar(20) not null,
   dept_name varchar(20),
   salary numeric(8,2) check (salary > 100000),
   primary key (ID),
   foreign key (dept_name) references department);
```

**Note**: For `foreign key` clause, we can specify what should the relation do
on deletion (`on delete`) and/or on update (`on update`) if referential
integrity constraint is violated. There are three option: `cascade` (delete the
tuple that refers to the deleted entry in other relation), `set null`, and `set
default` (set to default value for the domain).

We can insert an entry into the relation with the following codes:

```sql
insert into instructor
  values(10211, 'Smith', 'Biology', 66000);
```

Or with subquery:

```sql
insert into instructor
  select ID, name, dept_name, 100000
  from student
  where tot_cred > 100;
```

We can update entries in a relation (may be aided with `where` clause) with the
following codes:

```sql
update instructor
set salary = salary * 1.05
where salary <= 100000;
```

If there are several cases to handle, we can use the `case` and `end` clause
instead like below:

```sql
update instructor
set salary = case
                when salary <= 100000 then salary * 1.05
                else salary * 1.03
             end;
```

**Note**: Insertion and update can be aided with a `select` clause which will be
explained later.

In case that we need to delete all entries in the relation, we can execute the
command `delete from {relation}` or with `where` clause if we want to delete
only those that meet the condition specified. If the relation should be deleted
instead, use the command `drop table {relation}` instead. To alter the
[Attribute](202304200943.md) (column) in the relation, we can utilise the
command `alter table`, showcase in the following codes for different purposes:

```sql
-- add attribute gender with type char of size of 1 to the relation instructor
alter table instructor add gender char(1);
-- drop the attribute salary from the relation instructor
alter table instructor drop salary;
```

We can replicate the table with the command `create table ... like ...` by
passing the relation into the `like` clause shown below. If a result of a query
(see next paragraph) should be stored as a relation, we can use `create table
... as ... with data` for such purpose.

```sql
-- replicate the relation instructor
create table temp_instructor like instructor;

-- create a new relation from a query
create table t1 as
  (select *
   from instructor
   where dept_name = 'Music')
with data;
```

**Note**: Though by SQL:2003 standard, if `with data` is omitted, the newly
created relation will not be populated with data from the query, some database
implementation does this by default even with `with data` clause omitted.

Querying on one or more relation can be done with the command `select`, `from`,
and `where`. By default, `select` removes duplicate entries. This can be
overturned with a specifier as `select all`. Each [Attribute](202304200943.md)
in the `select` clause can perform individual arithmetic operations such as `+`,
`-`, `*`, and `/`. In the relation schemas in [Relational Model](202302101331.md),
we can query the instructor's name, their belong department's name, and the
building the department reside with the following SQL codes:

```sql
select name, instructor.dept_name, building
from instructor, department
where instructor.dept_name = department.dept_name;
```

**Note**: If there are duplicate names from two different relations, there is a
need to specify the relation as the prefix to the attribute in order to
distinguish the other. This is shown in the above as `dept_name` is prefixed
with `instructor` to avoid calling the same attribute name from the relation
`department`.

Other than `=`, comparison operators such as `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `<>` (not
equal) can be used. In addition, SQL provides logical connectives such as `and`,
`or`, and `not` to be used to express more complex query. Instead of using `=`
comparison operator, we can use `natural join` to join two relations that have
the same value for particular attributes. Otherwise, by simply `select` from two
different tables, it will result in a [Cartesian Product](202204281601.md) that
contains all tuples regardless of duplications. Natural join operation will
result in a new relation that has no duplicate entries. The above codes can be
rewritten as:

```sql
select name, instructor.dept_name, building
from instructor, department
where instructor natural join department;
```

Despite its convenience, `natural join` might erroneously collapse the
[Attributes](202304200943.md) that have the same name but different semantic
meaning in different relations. To avoid that, SQL provides `join ... using`
command to specify the attribute to be equated.

```sql
select name, title
from (instructor natural join teaches) join course using (course_id);
```

Other than `natural join` and `join ... using`, which is a kind called *inner
join* (in MySQL), SQL permits the use of *outer join* that automatically insert
(or more accurately, display) null attributes if one of the entry in a relation
doesn't have entry in another relation. In other words, it preserves those
tuples that might be lost otherwise in inner join since there are no attributes
of equal value for them to match. There are three kinds of outer join: `left
outer join` (preserve relation named before the operation), `right outer join`
(preserve relation named after), and `full outer join` (preserves tuples in both
relations). `on` clause can be used as part of outer join specification. `on` is
different from `where` in outer join due to the nature of outer join ability to
preserve tuples with no entry in other relation. The following codes show such
use case:

```sql
select *
from student left outer join takes on student.ID = takes.ID;
```

In some cases, the attributes or the relations should be renamed in order to
display the information properly or able to performed self comparison. The
command `as` can be used for such cases. The following codes shows two cases
when renaming can be useful:

```sql
-- To clarify the attribute's properties
select name as instructor_name, dept_name
from instructor, department
where instructor natural join department;

-- For relation's self comparison
select distinct T.name
from instructor as T, instructor as S
where T.salary > S.salary and S.dept_name = 'Biology';
```

**Note**: `distinct` keyword explicitly tell `select` or other commands to not
duplicate the same values for a single [Attribute](202304200943.md). Although it
is by default, sometimes it is better to specify it explicitly for more clarity
or in aggregation.

We can go further by displaying the value of an attribute if it match a pattern
using the `decode()` and `coalesce()` function. The codes below show how to
assign "-" to a NULL name in `instructor` relation.

```sql
select decode(name, NULL, '-', name)
from instructor;

select coalesce(name, '-')
from instructor;
```

**Note**: `coalesce()` can be used to find out the first non-null attribute from
the argument list. If all the attributes are null, then it returns null instead.

To match substrings, we can utilise the special character `%` (match any
substring) and `_` (match a character) in addition of the use of command `like`
to find the patterns in a relation. If, however, such behaviour is not desired
and instead the special character used must be matched, we can escape the
character by specifying the escape character used with the command `escape`. In
SQL:1999 version, `similar to` operations allow more advanced regular expression
for substring matching. The following shows the use case:

```sql
-- Match department names that contains Watson as a substring
select dept_name
from department
where building like '%Watson%';

-- Match the department name Fortune%
select dept_name
from department
where building like 'Fortune\%' escape '\';
```

We can `select` all attributes from a relation with `*`. Furthermore, the
ordering of the table can be manipulated to be ordered in ascending with `asc`
or descending order with `desc` according to an attribute. Multiple attributes
could be specified to be ordered in such way, where the ordering precedence took
from left to the right. The following codes show how it is used:

```sql
select *
from instructor
order by salary desc, name asc;
```

In some cases, the `where` clause can be simplified with tuple comparison
instead of individual comparisons. The following two queries mean the same:

```sql
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID and dept_name = 'Biology';

select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, 'Biology');
```

Additionally, we can perform [Set](202204281446.md) operations such as `union`,
`intersect`, and `except` (set difference) on two queries to create a new view
of a relation. By default, all set operations remove duplicates in the result.
To retain it, like in `select`, we can specify `all` quantifier to the set
commands. The following codes show how it is done:

```sql
(select course_id
 from section
 where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2009)
intersect
(select course_id
 from section
 where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2010);
```

SQL provides aggregation functions such as `avg()` (average), `min()` (finding
minimum), `max()` (finding maximum), `sum()`, `count()` (total number of
instances), `rank()` (ranking), `dense_rank()` (ranking but doesn't create
gaps), `percent_rank()`, `cume_dist()` (cumulative distribution),
`row_number()`, and `ntile({n})` (takes tuples in each partition in the
specified order and divides them into $n$ buckets with equal numbers of tuples)
that can be applied on [Attributes](202304200943.md) (`avg` and `sum` can only
be applied on a collection of numbers). We can improve the query by grouping in
specific attributes instead of applying on the entire relation with the command
`group by`. Together with another command `having` (applying constraints on
those grouped), we can have the following query with highly readable:

```sql
select dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary
from instructor
group by dept_name
having avg(salary) > 42000;

select ID, dept_name, rank() over (partition by dept_name order by GPA desc) as dept_rank
from dept_grades
order by dept_name, dept_rank;

select ID, ntile(4) over (order by (GPA desc)) as quartile
from student_grades;
```

**Note**: When using `group by`, ensure that any attribute that is not present
in the `group by` clause must appear only inside an aggregated function if it
appears in the `select` clause. Likewise, any attribute that is present in the
`having` clause without being aggregated must appear in the `group by clause.

**Note**: `partition by` is optional for `rank()` in which the ranking is done
on each partition separately. When a `group by` clause exists, the clause is
applied first, where the partitioning and ranking are done on the resulting
items.

With aggregation functions, we can calculate further over ranges of tuples with
the use of *window queries*. This can be done with `over` clause follows by an
enclosed `order by` clause with specified order (`preceding`, `following` or
`current row`) aided with the number of rows to be included (`row {number}` or
`row unbounded` for all tuples). The alternative for counting tuples is by
specifying a range (`range between ... and ...`). For example:

```sql
-- calculate the average number of credits for 3 previous year if there are
select year, avg(num_credits)
                over (order by year rows 3 preceding)
from tot_credits;

-- calculate the average number of credits for 4 previous year including the
-- current year
select year, avg(num_credits)
                over (order by year range between year - 4 and year)
from tot_credits;
```

Nested subqueries are possible in SQL with the keyword `in`, `not in`, `some`
(comparison), `all` (comparison), `exists` (tests presence), `not exists`,
`unique`, and `not unique` in the `where` clause. Basically, treat it like
finding or comparing the constraints put between two sets. The following queries
show some use cases of nested subqueries in `where` clause:

```sql
-- Finding courses that are opened in the Fall 2009 and Spring 2010
select distinct course_id
from section
where semester = 'Fall' and year = 2009 and
      course_id in (select course_id
                    from section
                    where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2010);

-- Finding instructors whose salary is larger than at least one instructor in Biology Department
select name
from instructor
where salary > some(select salary
                    from nistructor
                    where dept_name = 'Biology');

-- Finding courses that are offered at most once in 2009
select T.course_id
from course as T
where unique (select R.course_id
              from section as R
              where T.course_id = R.course_id and
                    R.year = 2009);
```

Subqueries are also possible in `from` clause, though with the limitation that
it can't access the outer scope's variable. SQL:2003, however, allows such
operation to the subqueries that are prefixed with the keyword `lateral`, but it
is not highly adopted by other SQL vendors. The subqueries in `from` can be
renamed using `as` command. Moreover, subqueries are also possible in `select`
clause, but with the condition that the generated relation can have only one
tuple containing a single [Attribute](202304200943.md) (termed *scalar
subqueries*).

We generate a temporary relation with the `with` command in which only available
to the query next to the clause. Any aggregation functions or clauses can be
applied to this temporary relation. For example:

```sql
with max_budget(value) as
    (select max(budget)
     from department)
select budget
from department, max_budget
where department.budget = max_budget.value;
```

We can create a view with the command `create view` from a query for convenience
and access control for precise query without showing any unnecessary information
that should be hidden to the user. The view can later be queried just like other
relation, sometimes, they are called *virtual relation*. The followings show the
code to do it:

```sql
create view physics_fall_2009 as
  select course.course_id, sec_id, building, room_number
  from course, section
  where course.course_id = section.course_id
               and course.dept_name ='Physics'
               and section.semester = 'Fall'
               and section.year = '2009';

select course_id
from physics_fall_2009
where building = 'Watson';
```

**Note**: Some [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md) allows
materialised views, that is, the result of the view query be stored in the
database instead of executing it on demand. It has the advantage of speeding up
often used query, but may not be up-to-date.

Depending on the implementation, the view can be `update` only in limited
circumstances to avoid potential hassles on violating [Data Integrity](202210040913.md).
Generally, it can be `update` if:
- the `from` clause has only one relation
- the `select` clause contains simple [Attribute](202304200943.md) names (no
  expressions, aggregations, or `distinct`)
- the attribute not listed can be null (no `not null` or is not primary key)
- doesn't have `group by` or `having` clause

`create assertion` can be an alternative of `check` clause as the latter may be
too costly to check in runtime. Instead, assertion enforced the constraint to be
satisfied at all time. The codes below show the use case of an assertion:

```sql
create assertion credits_earned_constraint check
(not exists (select ID
             from student
             where tot_cred <> (select sum(credits)
             from takes natural join course
             where student.ID = takes.ID
                   and grade is not null and grade <> 'F')))
```

Index can be useful in finding tuples in the relation that have a specified
value for that attribute efficiently, that is without scanning through all the
entries of the relation. Although not standardised, most SQL implementation
supports the following syntax for index creation:

```sql
create index studentID_index on student(ID);
```

Like procedural languages, SQL can create functions (`function`) and procedures
(`procedure`) with similar syntax `create` or `create or replace` that can
return types and even table (depend on the SQL implementation). SQL function
define the parameters within the parenthesises and use the keyword `return` to
indicate its return types (which can be a table sometime). For procedure, the
structure is overall the same but using `in` keyword to indicate parameters and
`out` for return types. The following shows their syntax and use case:

```sql
-- get number of instructors in the department
create function dept_count(dept_name varchar(20))
    returns integer
    begin
    declare d_count integer;
        select count(*) into d_count
        from instructor
        where instructor.dept_name = dept_name
    return d_count;
    end

-- same as above but with procedure
create procedure dept_count_proc(in dept_name varchar(20),
                                 out d_count integer)
    begin
        select count(*) into d_count
        from instructor
        where instructor.dept_name = dept_count_proc.dept_name
    end

-- get the view of instructors in the department
create function instructors_of(dept_name varchar(20))
    returns table (
        ID varchar (5),
        name varchar (20),
        dept_name varchar (20),
        salary numeric (8,2))
    return table
        (select ID, name, dept_name, salary
         from instructor
         where instructor.dept_name = instructor_of.dept_name);
```

We can externalise the procedure and function with the keyword `external name`
and specify the #programming-language used with `language`. For example:

```sql
create function dept_count(dept_name varchar(20))
returns integer
language C
external name '/usr/bin/dept_count'
```

Other branching and loop statements can be declared with `declare`, `while`,
`repeat`, `set`, `if-elseif-else` etc. Furthermore, we can handle the exception
with the declaration of handlers such as the following:

```sql
declare exception_to_hdl condition
declare exit handler for exception_to_hdl
begin
-- SQL statements to handle the exception
end
```

**Note**: Like function and procedure creation, the error handling can be
differed in syntax and semantic in other [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md)
implementation.

To execute a recursive query, instead of relying on iteration defined in a
`function`, we can use `with recursive` for temporary recursive view or `create
recursive view` for permanent recursive view. A recursive view consists of a
union of *base query* and *recursive query* like in [Recursive Function](202202151731.md)
(has base condition(s) and a recursive call). Such view must be **monotonic**,
that is no aggregation and set differences (with `not exists` on subqueries or
`except` on recursive query), meaning the set can't become smaller for each
recursive iteration. The following shows the likely syntax for a recursive view
definition:

```sql
with recursive c_prereq(course_id, prereq_id) as (
        select course_id, prereq_id
        from prereq
    union
        select prereq.prereq_id, c_prereq.course_id
        from prereq, c_prereq
        where prereq.course_id = c_prereq.prereq_id
    )
select * from c_prereq;
```

We can have a mechanism to automatically executes SQL statements as a result of
side effect of the modification to the database. Such mechanism is called
`trigger` in SQL. The trigger can be triggered `before` or `after` the `insert`,
`delete`, and `update` on a relation. The `referencing new row as` clause
creates a variable that stores the value of a row after the trigger condition
(`update` and `insert`), and in contrast, `referencing old row as` clause
referred to the old value (`update` and `delete`). The trigger can operate `for
each row` (affected) or `for each statement` (SQL statement). The condition for
the trigger to be triggered is specified in `when` clause. For example:

```sql
create trigger timeslot_check after insert on section
referencing new row as nrow
for each row
when (nrow.time_slot_id not in (
        select time_slot_id
        from time_slot))
begin
  rollback
end;

create trigger credits_earned after update of takes on grade
referencing new row as nrow
referencing old row as orow
for each row
when nrow.grade <> 'F' and nrow.grade is not null
     and (orow.grade = 'F' or orow.grade is null)
begin atomic
  update student
  set tot_cred = tot_cred +
          (select credits
           from course
           where course.course_id = nrow.course_id)
  where student.id = nrow.id;
end;
```

**Note**: `referencing old table as` or `referencing new table as` can be used
to refer to temporary tables containing all the affected rows.

The trigger can be disabled with the command `alter trigger {trigger-name}
disable` or drop altogether with `drop trigger {trigger-name}`. Despite its
usefulness, trigger can be a problem in *database replication*. Most of the
modern database disables trigger in replicated database with specified keyword
or marks the database as replica in which the trigger is replayed once only.
