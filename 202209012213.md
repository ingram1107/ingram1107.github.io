# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

AES is one of the implementations of #[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, which was once called Rijndael. It
could use either 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys to encrypt 128 bit of data with an
iterative manner ~~rather than adopting [Feistel Cipher Structure](202210052211.md)#~~.
AES processes data as block of 4 columns of 4 bytes. It will then operate on the
entire data block in every round (up to 9, 11, 13 rounds) with byte
[substitution](202209281136.md)#, [shift rows](202210052159.md)#, mix columns
(substitution using matrix multiply of group), add round key (XOR the data block
with key), and view the data block as alternate XOR key and scramble data bytes.

AES utilises the properties of [Galois Field](202210100956.md)#.

It sees wide adoption from US government, and becomes the fundamental data
encryption standard used by the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) in order to
secure wireless networks.
