# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

AES is one of the implementations of #[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, which was once called Rijndael. It
could use either 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys to encrypt 128 bit of data with an
iterative manner (operates on entire block every round) rather than adopting
[Feistel Cipher Structure](202210052211.md)#. There were three initial criteria
for AES evaluation: security, computational cost, and algorithm and
implementation characteristics. Final criteria for AES evaluation were: general
security, software and hardware implementation ease, implementation attacks
(practical attacks on the actual implementation), and flexibility (in terms of
encryption, decryption, keying etc.).

AES processes data as block of 4 columns of 4 bytes. It will then operate on the
entire data block in every round (up to 9, 11, 13 rounds) with byte
[substitution](202209281136.md)#, [shift rows](202210052159.md)#, mix columns
(substitution using matrix multiply of group), and add round key (XOR the data block
with key) which view the data block as alternate XOR key and scramble data
bytes. Decryption is done in reverse to encryption process.

**Note**: Initially, a round key will be produced based on the data block and
key input in encryption and decryption.

AES utilises the properties of [Galois Field](202210100956.md)#.

It sees wide adoption from US government, and becomes the fundamental data
encryption standard used by the Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) in order to
secure wireless networks.
