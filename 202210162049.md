# Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)

VLSM is basically #[Subnetting](202206280939.md) the subnet. The process is
almost identical to of [Fix-Length Subnet Masking](202210152323.md) with the
exception where it reduces $BL$ to only include enough number of hosts in the
network, that is $2^{BL}$ should be close to $\lg{n}$. The bits deducted from
$BL$, denoted as $BD$ will be the bits that used to build up a subnet mask
(though in reality it is counted as part of the prefix). $2^{BD}$ will be the
total number of subnets that could be subnetted from their parent.

**Note**: The minimum requirements for $BL$ should be at least 2 bits since
there are two addresses reversed for network address and broadcast address.

We could conserve even more IP addresses by *subnetting the subnetted subnet* if
it is still too large and there are plenty of spaces left to include more hosts
after one round of VLSM. It could build up a [Hierarchical Network](202207071052.md).

Not only is VLSM able to conserve [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md), it is also a
more efficient way of using available address space.
