# Waterfall Development Model

Waterfall development model delegates the testing to an independent group of
testers after the [System](202303242148.md) functionalities have be developed.

It typically has the following phases (collectively called [software testing life cycle (STLC)](202304091918.md)):
1. [Requirement](202303251303.md) analysis (start at [requirement phase](202303251030.md),
   determining testable aspects of a design and parameters needed for the test
   in design phase)
2. Test planning (test strategy, test plan, testbed creation)
3. Test development (test procedures, test scenarios, test cases, test datasets,
   test scripts)
4. Test execution (report errors found during executing #software based on the
   test plan and documents)
5. Test reporting (generate metrics and final reports, determining whether the
   software is deliverable)
6. Test result analysis/Defect analysis (decide which defects should be
   assigned, fixed, rejected or deferred for later together with the client)
7. Defect retesting/Resolution testing (retest defect)
8. [Regression Testing](202206201335.md)
9. Test closure (archive activities, lessons, logs, documents for future
   reference)
