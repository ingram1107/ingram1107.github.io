# Switch Considerations

When considering a [Switch](202207051907.md)#, we should inspect the traffic
flow analysis (bandwidth usage and data analysis), user community analysis
(impact of the user groups on network performance), data sources and data
servers analysis (their locations and traffic for client-server and
server-server), and network topology (port numbers, aggregated ports, redundant
paths, etc.). Furthermore, we need to inquire the ability of the switch such as
port density, forwarding rate, link aggregation ability, Power over Ethernet
(PoE) ability, and Layer 3 functionality (using multilayer switch). Typically,
lower performing switch should be in [access layer](202212062234.md)# whereas
higher performing one should be in distribution and core layers.
