# Software Defined Network (SDN)

SDN is a concept of the physical separation of the network control plane from
the forwarding plane, and where a control plane controls several [Network Devices](202207051821.md).
From the highest hierarchy to the lowest, it has **management plane**
(consisting applications or [Control Program](202305151920.md)), **control
plane** (like [Network Operating System](202305151917.md)), and **data plane**
(network devices). The communication between the control plane and data plane
could be established via [OpenFlow](202305151926.md). The following figure shows
its rough architecture:
