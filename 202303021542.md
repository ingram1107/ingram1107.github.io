# WLAN Roaming

[WLAN](202302161710.md) Roaming is a term to describe switching from the control
of one [Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md) to another. This is done by the
reassociation request from [IEEE 802.11](202303292155.md) to establish a
connection to the new AP discovered. A good roaming scheme ensures that when a
user moves away from one AP, where the power and signal quality decrease,
another AP signal will be strong enough to take over the wireless connection,
while the whole process is transparent (unnoticed) by the user. It typically
follows the below steps:
1. The device decides that the link to its current AP is poor.
2. The device scans (active or passive) another AP which also considering the
   information from previous scans.
3. The device sends reassociation request to the new AP.
4. If the reassociation response is successful, the device is roamed to the new
   AP, otherwise it scans for another AP.
5. If AP accepts the reassociation request, it indicates such reassociation to
   the [Distribution System (DS)](202304171340.md) to update its information.
   The old AP is notified through the DS.
