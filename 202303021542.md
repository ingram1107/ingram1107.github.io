# WLAN Roaming

[WLAN](202302161710.md) Roaming is a term to describe switching from the control
of one access point (AP) to another. A good roaming scheme ensures that when a
user moves away from one AP, where the power and signal quality decrease,
another AP signal will be strong enough to take over the wireless connection,
while the whole process is transparent (unnoticed) by the user.
