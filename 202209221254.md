# Perl Hash

Perl Hash is a logically discontinuous data structure (meaning the first item
referred to the hash is not necessarily the first item that you input). It can
be defined like the following:

```perl
my %hash = qw ( name Ingram age 22 );
```

The odd number of scalars defined the keys to be stored, and the even number of
scalars will be the values for the key. This means that to define a hash, you
need to have an even number of scalars pass as the `qw()` parameters. However,
there is a more readable way to define a hash, shown below:

```perl
my %hash = ( name=>Ingram, age=>22 );
```

Or with #[Perl Reference](202207211229.md) using curly braces `{}`:

```perl
my $hashRef = { name=>Ingram, age=>22 };
```

**Note**: Be aware that Hash will be treated as list in other contexts such as
[Perl Array](202209201839.md). Since there is no association between keys and
values in a list, passing a Hash to an array will destroy the established
relationship. One of the solution is to use #[Perl Reference](202207211229.md).

To get the value of the key from the hash, using the "$" sigil and the following
syntax. However if the key hasn't been created before this,
[undef](202207192226.md)# will be returned.

```perl
my $name = $hash{name}
```

Other than keys and values, Perl Hash stores a special variable called iterator
that could be used by the `each()` to return a pair of key and value and then
advance to the next pair. The function will return an empty list when it
encountered no pair left after the current pair, which is recognised by the
[Perl Boolean](202207211219.md)# as false. Its usage could be as simple as
iterating through the hash using a while loop, such as the following:

```perl
while(my($key, $value)=each(%hash)) {
  print "key='$key', value='$value'\n";
}
```

**Note**: We could reset the iterator by calling the function `keys()` on the
Perl Hash.

We can also test whether the key specified exists in the Perl Hash using the
function `exist()`. However, keep in mind that it doesn't work well with
multi-level hash verification, that is there is a hash table contained in
another hash table. Perl will [autovivify](202207192226.md)# all the lower-level
keys and will not check the validity of the higher-level key. Therefore, it is
recommended to test the key *individually*, *level by level*, *from high to
low*, in order to prevent such bug from happening.

Perl hash could be used for [Object-Oriented Programming](202202041514.md) with
the help from the `bless()` function as the latter gives reference a name for
the returned hash to be referred to.
