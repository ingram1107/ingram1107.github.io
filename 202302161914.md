# Transmission Delay

Transmission delay is the delay in which the [Network Device](202207051821.md)
must receive the entire packet before transmission. Such delay is proportional
to the to be sent packet's length, that can be calculated using the following
formulae:

$$
d_{\text{trans}} = \frac{L}{R}
$$

Where:
- $L$ is the packet length
- $R$ is the transmission rate
