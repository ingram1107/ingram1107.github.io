# Project Procurement Management

Project procurement management includes the processes needed to purchase or
acquire products, services, or results necessary from outside the project team.
The organisation plans for such processes can be either a
[buyer](202304161344.md) or seller of these products, services, or results of a
project.

The processes are:
1. Procurement planning (determine what to acquire and when using make-or-buy
   financial analysis)
2. Solicitation planning ([Requirement Documentation](202304011057.md) and
   potential source identification by preparing [Request for Proposals (RFP)](202304162130.md)
   and [Requests for Quotation (RFQ)](202304162132.md))
3. Solicitation (obtain quotations, bids, offers, or proposals as appropriate
   from preferred or potential vendors or anyone else)
4. Source selection (choose among potential vendors with formal evaluation
   procedures or short list to evaluate bidder's proposals, choose, negotiate
   contract and award the contract)
5. Contract administration (manage relationship between vendors, ensure seller's
   performance meets contractual criteria)
6. Contract close-out (complete the contract, verify the product, update records
   to reflect final results, archive information to identify lessons learned in
   the procurement process)

A successful procurement can't be done without [Audit Trail](202304302032.md)
and the follow of internal rules, processes, and procedures.
