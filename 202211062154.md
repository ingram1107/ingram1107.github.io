# Block/Columnar Transposition Cipher

Columnar Transposition Cipher is a #[Permutation/Transposition Cryptography](202210052159.md)
#algorithm that arrange plaintext in an order specified by a key (a sequence of
numbers or a word) accordingly in a column to produce ciphertext. The key size
determines how long should the plaintext be written in a row before proceed to
a new line.

For example, given the example plaintext "attack postponed until two am" with a
key "3 4 2 1 5 6 7". Write the plaintext according to the key size like the
following (fill in alphabets if there are spaces left):

```
Key:        3 4 2 1 5 6 7
Plaintext:  a t t a c k p
            o s t p o n e
            d u n t i l t
            w o a m x y z
```

The produced ciphertext is `APTMTTNAAODWTSUOCOIXKNLYPETZ`.

A [Cryptanalysis](202209281128.md) could be done to this cipher by simply
analysing the number of characters used in the ciphertext and guess the number
of columns it's using.
