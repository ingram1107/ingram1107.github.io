# Bottom-Up Integration Testing

Bottom-up approach of [Integration Testing](202206201330.md) starts the module
integration from atomic module (components at the lowest level of a program
structure). There is no need of [stubs](202206201320.md) as the processing
required for components subordinate to a given level is always available.
