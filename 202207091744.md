# Assertions

Assertions in programming languages such as #c, #cpp and #rust are used as a
mean of comparing the output of a function or method of a class to the expected
value. They can be incorporated well into the [test facility](202206201159.md)
like Rust.

In C and C++, the keywords `assert` and `_assert` are usually viewed as a
[Debugging Tools](202203061248.md). However, as recommended by
[Hunt et al.](lit/@Hunt1999.md), if you ever feel that
#[something can't happen](202207091727.md), it is a great opportunity to ensure
it won't by using assertions. Even though assertions can add overhead to the
program, turning them off when building the binary is a bad idea since it
assumes tests alone would find every bug in the codebase which is not the case.

**Note**: Never put code that must be executed into assertions as it might be
turned off by some pricks.

**Note**: Avoid side effects in assertions at all costs.

**Don't use** assertions as a mean of error handling! The difference between the
two is the former checks things that *must not happen*, the latter checks things
that *could happen*.
