# Assertions

Assertions in programming languages such as [C](202302190647.md),
[C++](202302190651.md) and #rust are used as a mean of comparing the output of a
function or method of a class to the expected value. They can be incorporated
well into the [test facility](202206201159.md) like Rust.

In C and C++, the keywords `assert` and `_assert` are usually viewed as a
[Debugging Tools](202203061248.md). However, as recommended by [Hunt et al.](lit/@Hunt1999.md),
if you ever feel that #[something can't happen](202207091727.md), it is a great
opportunity to ensure it won't by using assertions. Even though assertions can
add overhead to the program, turning them off when building the binary is a bad
idea since it assumes tests alone would find every bug in the codebase which is
not the case. `_Static_assert` (GCC) and `static_assert` (since C++11), are
compile time assertions (thus doesn't have the overhead most assertions met)
that can be used for testing the interface.[^brindle2021]

**Note**: Never put code that must be executed into assertions as it might be
turned off by some pricks.

**Note**: Avoid side effects in assertions at all costs.

**Don't use** assertions as a mean of error handling! The difference between the
two is the former checks things that *must not happen*, the latter checks things
that *could happen*.
