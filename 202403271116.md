# MESI

MESI, as in **Modified**, **Exclusive**, **Shared**, and **Invalid**, is a cache
coherency protocol used by CPUs. When there is operation should be done on the
cache line, the request CPU will put an announcement on its external pins for
other to notice.

**Note**: Some clich√© here, cache with a modified state is usually implied to be
the only copy among the caches. Invalid state also implies that the cache line
is not used.

Shared cache line will be received by second processor and processed by memory
controller which will store the content in the memory. If a write access is
requested to the shared cache line, a *request for ownership (RFO)* will be
performed in the last level cache, and then mark the cache line as *invalid*.
RFO is expensive, like the state transition between invalid state to modified
state. Overall, exclusive state is generally used by processors as it is
efficient since there is no need of RFO operations. Of course, there are cases
where RFOs are necessary, such as in the case of thread migration and necessary
shared cache line.

Processor usually assumes immutable code pages, in the case of instruction
caching, and use simple SI protocol as an alternative to MESI. However, if it
meets some edge cases, such as [Self-Modifying Code (SMC)](202403292209.md), it
will make pessimistic assumptions, which will severely handicap the performance.
