# Mobile Middleware

Middleware in mobile device context comprises a collection of services that are
responsible of provisioning functionality for cross-platform application
construction. (See system integration consept of [Middleware](202304201955.md)).
It should support remote #communication, [Tasks or Threads Synchronisation](202404301021.md),
#caching, event notification, #multimedia, #security, and #graphics.

When operating in wireless environments, middleware has to be able to transform
content (#html to WML), detect and adjust devices, compress data, ensure
security, deliver message, and support operations. It can operate in
[client-server model](202407251937.md), [client-agent-server model](202407251946.md),
or [client-intercept-server model](202407251954.md).

Examples of middleware include:
- [Java Platform, Micro-Edition (Java ME)](202407242222.md)
- .NET Compact Framework (CF)
- [Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)](202405192127.md)
- I-mode
- Mobile Internet Toolkit (MIT)
- eMbedded Visual Toolkit (eVT)
- Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
- Service Location Protocol (SLP)
