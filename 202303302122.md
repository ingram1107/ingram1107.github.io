# Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)

OFDMA is a [Medium Access Control (MAC) Technologies](202303301623.md) assigning
subsets of subcarriers to individual users on the basis of 
[Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md) and [Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)](202209091302.md)
that allow simultaneous data rate transmission from several users. It utilises
[Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)](202404111037.md), and a
subset of sub-carriers is assigned to a particular user.

Examples of technology that employs OFDMA are:
- [Mobile WiMAX](202305181312.md)
- [Forth-Generation Cellular Network (4G)](202303312039.md)
- [Fifth-Generation Cellular Network (5G)](202305112009.md)
