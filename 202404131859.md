# Polled Loop with Delay

Polled loop with delay is a [Polled Loop System](202404131853.md) that uses a
fixed clock interrupt to wait a period of time in between the change of the flag
status. It is particularly useful in treating contact bounce behaviour where
flag status could swing between two states in short burst of time (usually 20
ms).
