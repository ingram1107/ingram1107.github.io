# Distributed Object Architecture

Distributed object architecture is a kind of distributed system where any object
on the system may provide and use services from other objects. Unlike in
[Client-Server Architecture](202304202049.md), there is no distinction between
clients and servers, and it is more complex than it. Object communication is
done through an object request broker or a software bus, which is a
[Middleware](202304201955.md).

This [System Architecture](202303242154.md) is a very open system architecture
that enables new resources to be added to it as required, which increases system
flexibility and scalability. It allows the delay of decisions on where and how
services should be provided. Dynamic system reconfiguration with objects
migrating across the network is possible.
