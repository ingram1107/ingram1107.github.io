# Signal

Signal is a notification sent asynchronously to a #[Process](202210062301.md)
that an event has occurred typically used in #unix like operating system.
Signals are notoriously expensive due to the underlying signal facility. Many of
the implementations of signal don't support queuing or counting of signals,
piggyback, defined delivery order, priority level, and no guarantee on
deliverable unblocked pending signal.

Signals are defined in #c library `signal.h`. All supported signals could be
viewed with the command `kill -l` or `kill -L`. Special signals SIGUSR1 and
SIGUSR2 are user defined signals that could be used for process communication.

It could be sent using `kill()` [Unix System Call](202210062303.md)# by
specifying the target process ID and the signal sent, or `raise()` to send
Signal to the current process. SIGALRM can be raised using the system call
`alarm()` with a parameter that specify when will the signal be delivered in
seconds. `pause()` can be used to put the calling process into suspend until
there is a Signal raised.

Detecting the process termination by [`SIGPIPE`](202210280908.md) is rather
hard, therefore, it is advised to simply ignore it just like the default.

The control block on signal maintains a set of wanted signal (which also could
be ignored, pending, processed, or blocked) and a signal handler.
