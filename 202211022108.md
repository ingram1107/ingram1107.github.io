# Signal

Signal is a notification sent asynchronously to a #[Process](202210062301.md)
that an event has occurred typically used in #unix like operating system.

Signals are defined in #c library `signal.h`. All supported signals could be
viewed with the command `kill -l` or `kill -L`. Special signals SIGUSR1 and
SIGUSR2 are user defined signals that could be used for process communication.

It could be sent using `kill()` [Unix System Call](202210062303.md)# by
specifying the target process ID and the signal sent, or `raise()` to send
Signal to the current process. SIGALRM can be raised using the system call
`alarm()` with a parameter that specify when will the signal be delivered in
seconds. `pause()` can be used to put the calling process into suspend until
there is a Signal raised.
