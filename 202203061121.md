# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a [Programming Language Paradigm](202302152003.md)
that its primary means of computation is applying functions to given parameters.

Functional Programming focus on [Pure Function](202202081524.md)# and avoids
mutable state. To change the value, most functional programming languages use
new copy to change value, but this could be expensive.
