# Bridge Pattern

Bridge pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) decouples an abstraction
from its implementations, especially those of platform-specific, by separating
them into different class hierarchies. Usually such task is done in a single
hierarchy, but extending it requires extensive subclassing particularly when
there are multiple platforms to be concerned, which also commits client code to
a specific implementation. It provides a stable interface for numerous and
possibly expanding implementation options. The two class hierarchies are
**abstraction** and **implementor**. Implementor classes define primitives
operations that is platform-specific which will be used by abstraction classes
to build higher-level operations. The abstraction class maintains a reference to
the implementor and forwards the requests to the implementor.

**Note**: Though similar to [Abstract Factory Pattern](202303271021.md), bridge
pattern doesn't attempt to provide common abstract class for different
hierarchies.

There are different approaches to implement the pattern. If the abstraction
knows all the implementations, it can instantiate them accordingly based on the
parameter passed to the constructor. Otherwise, we can choose a default
implementation that can be changed later. Another approach is to create an
abstract factory object and delegate the decision on choosing implementation to
the object.

The Gang of Four advised to use bridge pattern when:
1. To avoid permanent binding (able to change in runtime) between abstraction
   and its implementations.
2. Both the abstractions and implementations should be extensible by
   subclassing.
3. To avoid impacts on client (doesn't require recompilation) upon changes on
   the implementations.
4. To hide implementations completely from clients in [C++](202302190651.md).
5. There is a [nested generalisation](202303261653.md).
6. To share implementations among multiple objects and hide the fact from the
   client.
