# Data Centre

Data Centre is a centralised facility housing computer systems with redundant
data communications connections, high-speed virtual servers (server farms or
server clusters), redundant storage systems, redundant or backup power supplies,
environment controls (air conditioning and fire suppression), and security
devices. The internal design usually deploys the [n-Tier Model](202302131519.md).
When designing, power capacity, cooling capacity, [cabling](202209271520.md),
temperature and humidity controls, fire and smoke detection systems, restricted
access and surveillance systems, and space planning for future expansion should
be considered.

Based on the logical functions, Data Centre can be divided into several layers:
1. *Aggregation* by connecting Data Centre to the corporate backbone network
   which could consists of [Firewall](202301211140.md), [content switches](202207051907.md),
   Call Managers, and Content Distribution Managers
2. *Front-end* where the users interact with
3. *Application* or middleware
4. *Back-end* where the data is stored in a [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md)
5. *Storage* involving technologies such as [Fibre-Channel](202302131547.md) and
   backup (sometime involves [Load Balancing](202210242151.md))
6. *High-speed interconnect* using [Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md) between
   distributed server across multiple Data Centres

Security services such as [Access Control List (ACL)](202302190738.md),
[Firewall](202301211140.md), [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](202303081739.md),
and [Triple A (AAA)](202210221150.md) should be considered given the importance
of the Data Centre.

It can be categorised into three main types based on the type of network it
support:
- **Internet server farm** that are accessible from the Internet and are
  available to a large community accessing via #web interfaces and browsers.
- **Intranet server farm** that has the similar function to Internet counterpart
  but only available to internet network users
- **Extranet server farm** that uses web-based application but only accessible
  to selected group of users who are neither Internet- nor intranet-based.
