# Unix Philosophy

> Do One Thing And Do It Well[^dougmcIlroy]

Design small, simple but sharp tools with [well-contained functionality](202202041514.md).
They don't need to do more or less than what they claimed to do (similar to
[202206301938](202206301938.md)). Let them accept one universal format - the
text stream. And make these programs work together.

In Unix, almost all things, such as users, [passwords](202301022333.md), networking configuration,
are configured through and/or kept in [plain text](lit/@Hunt1999.md).
