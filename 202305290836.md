# Document Type Definition (DFD)

DFD defines an [Extensible Markup Language (XML)](202305281742.md) document's
structure. It allows individual user groups to check their structure and
exchange data in standardised format and determines how many times an element
may appear and how child elements are ordered.

There are mainly two kinds of data type and declaration. `PCDATA` and `CDATA`
distinguish the data type whether the character data has been parsed. `ElEMENT`
type declaration defines rules apply on an element including its structure,
conforms to the format `<!ELEMENT {element-name} ({content-model})>` where the
content model could be a specific rule or data type (`#PCDATA` or `#CDATA`) or
another element(s). `ATTLIST` declaration defines an attribute to an element
within a root element or container element, conforms to the format `<!ATTRLIST
{element-name} {attribute-name} {type} {default-value}>` where the type
parameter determines the attribute's data type (`PCDATA` or `CDATA`). The order
of the element declarations is crucial in determining the element structure and
is enforced by DFD. The following shows an example of DFD declaration:

```xml
<!ELEMENT trainlog (session)+>

<!ELEMENT session (duration, distance, location, comments)>
<!ATTLIST session
date CDATA #IMPLIED
type (running | swimming | cycling) "running"
heartrate CDATA #IMPLIED
>

<!ELEMENT duration (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST duration
units (seconds | minutes | hours) "minutes"
>

<!ELEMENT distance (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST distance
units (miles | kilometers | laps) "miles"
>

<!ELEMENT location (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT comments (#PCDATA)>
```

**Note**: If an element has its content model be declared as a data type in
`ELEMENT` type declaration, it must not contain any element within itself.

The above DFD can be declared internally or externally. To declare DFD rules
inside an XML document, we wrapped the rules around `<!DOCTYPE {root-element}
[... declarations ...]>`. Similarly, if the rules are resided in the `file.dtd`,
we can import it via the declaration `<!DOCTYPE {root-element} SYSTEM
"file.dtd">`.
