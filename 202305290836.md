# Document Type Definition (DTD)

DTD defines an [Extensible Markup Language (XML)](202305281742.md) document's
structure. It allows individual user groups to check their structure and
exchange data in standardised format and determines how many times an element
may appear and how child elements are ordered.

There are mainly two kinds of data type and declaration. `PCDATA` and `CDATA`
distinguish the data type whether the character data has been parsed. `ElEMENT`
type declaration defines rules apply on an element including its structure,
conforms to the format `<!ELEMENT {element-name} ({content-model})>` where the
content model could be a specific rule (`EMPTY` or `ANY`) or data type
(`#PCDATA` or `#CDATA`) or another element(s). `ATTLIST` declaration defines an
attribute to an element within a root element or container element, conforms to
the format `<!ATTRLIST {element-name} {attribute-name} {type} {default-value}>`
where the type parameter determines the attribute's data type (`PCDATA` or
`CDATA`). The order of the element declarations is crucial in determining the
element structure and is enforced by DTD. The following shows an example of DTD
declaration:

```xml
<!ELEMENT trainlog (session)+>

<!ELEMENT session (duration, distance, location, comments)>
<!ATTLIST session
date CDATA #IMPLIED
type (running | swimming | cycling) "running"
heartrate CDATA #IMPLIED
>

<!ELEMENT duration (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST duration
units (seconds | minutes | hours) "minutes"
>

<!ELEMENT distance (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST distance
units (miles | kilometers | laps) "miles"
>

<!ELEMENT location (#PCDATA)>

<!ELEMENT comments (#PCDATA)>
```

**Note**: If an element has its content model be declared as a data type in
`ELEMENT` type declaration, it must not contain any element within itself.

Notice that the parameters for `trainlog` has an operator `+` to indicates the
parameter's cardinality. This means that the element may appear either one or
more times. Other indicators are `?` for once or not at all and `*` for zero or
more times.

From the above example, we can see that `date` attribute has the type of
`CDATA` (character data) with the specifier of `#IMPLIED` (attribute is
optional). Other attribute types for attribute declaration are `ID` (unique
identifier of the attribute), `IDREF` (must refer to an `ID` value), `IDREFS`
(for multiple `ID` values), `ENTITY`, `ENTITIES`, `NMTOKEN` (like `CDATA` but
doesn't accept space character), `NMTOKENS`, `NOTATION` (specify the format of
non-XML data), and list of values like `(seconds | minutes | hours)`. Other
specifiers include `#FIXED` (fix default value) and `#REQUIRED` (attribute must
be present, one value is required).

We can declare an **entity* as a storage unit to contain XML codes which can act
as abbreviation to reduce repetitive information. One can declare an entity and
refer to it follows the below example:

```xml
<!-- Internal parsed entity -->
<!ENTITY xml "Extensible Markup Language">

<!-- External parsed entity -->
<!-- Private -->
<!ENTITY xml SYSTEM "xml.html">
<!-- Public -->
<!ENTITY xml PUBLIC "xml.html">

<!-- External unparsed entity -->
<!ENTITY xml SYSTEM "https://ww.abc.net/xml.html" NDATA abb>
<!ENTITY xml PUBLIC "-//W3C//XML//EN" "https://ww.abc.net/xml.html" NDATA abb>

...

<title>&xml;</title>
```

The above DTD can be declared internally or externally. To declare DTD rules
inside an XML document, we wrapped the rules around `<!DOCTYPE {root-element}
[... declarations ...]>`. Similarly, if the rules are resided in the `file.dtd`,
we can import it via the declaration `<!DOCTYPE {root-element} SYSTEM
"file.dtd">`.
