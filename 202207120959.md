# Prototyping

Prototyping is a #[Software Development Practices](202207121011.md) which is cheap
and fast to be developed as typical prototype usually ignores most of the
details such as *correctness* (using dummy data), *completeness* (may function
only in a very limited sense, only work on a given input data or only one menu
item available), *robustness* (incomplete error checking, great crashing
possibility) and *style* (little to no comments and/or documentation).

The prototype developed could be either code-based (in higher level language
such as #python, #perl, Tcl, Tcl/Tk, Visual Basic, Powerbuilder or Delphi) or
just written down to sticky notes. Sticky notes are great to illustrate
something dynamic, such as workflow and application logic. Sometimes, drawing
can be another way to develop the prototype, especially when focuses on user
interface. In the end, the form of the prototype taken into doesn't matter, as
it served only for learning and to answer just a few questions. As such, it is
meant to be disposed afterwards. Trying to incorporate it directly into the
production environment can be a grave mistake.

Prototyping could be especially helpful when you want to test something out or
just to clear your mind. If you are not sure whether the project is sound or it
is just your procrastination, developing a prototype for it is a great time. If
you felt you are wasting time on it, then there is probably nothing to worry
about the project. However, if as the time goes, your doubts has been solidified
into crystallised arguments based on the observation, that you know that some
premises or assumptions are wrong in the prototype, then show it to your team
and decide whether to improve the model or simply don't waste time on it.

The following shows things that could be prototyped:
- Architecture
- New functionality in an existing system
- Structure or contents or external data
- Third-party tools or components
- Performance issues
- User interface design

**Note**: When building a prototype for architecture, we should inspect on how
the system hangs together as a whole in a higher level. Turn our focus on the
major components' responsibilities and collaboration between those to see
whether they are well-defined and appropriate. Investigate the coupling (is it
minimised?) of the architecture. Find out whether there are potential
[sources of duplication](202206171004.md). Are the interface definitions and
constraints acceptable? Pay attention to modules' accessibility (access path and
the access) to the data it needs during the program execution.

**Note**: Only develop prototype when necessary.
