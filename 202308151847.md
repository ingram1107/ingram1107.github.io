# Islam

Islam, its name, is originated from the Arab word *salima* (سلم) which means
peace. It aims to protect human five needs, which are the religion, the moral
(jiwa), the heritage, the idea, and the property.

There is the concept called al-Dharuriyyat, that is the things that must exist
in order to provide benefits towards the religion and the world. If not, there
will unbalance in the world, thus the chaos reigns. Another concept called
al-Hajiyyat, referring to the need of something that could bring relief. Based
on these assumptions, it establishes al-Tahsiniyyat, stating the importance of
good practices and the sins' vile.

A typical Islamic [Civilisation](202308072126.md) bases its philosophy around
al-Qur'an, al-Sunnah (practices of the prophet Muhammad), ijtihad, ijmak, qiyas,
and syura, preaching universality (kesejagatan), openness, longevity (sepanjang
zaman), tolerance, unity in diversity, and keeping balance between spirituality
and materialism. The characteristics of an Islamic civilisation includes the
environment (rabbani), perfection (sempurna dan menyeluruh), universal, and
idealistic and realistic. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful coexistence between
human and the environment generally, and preach the worship to the God by
following the shown procedure and the way of life of Prophet Muhammad.
