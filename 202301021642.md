# Intruder

Intruder, sometimes called hacker and cracker, is an unauthorised individual
that is trying to exploit the system without permission or an authorised
individual who misused their trust to perform malicious activities. The basic
objective of them is to **gain access** ([acquiring passwords](202301021707.md)#)
or **escalate privileges** on the system. They could be classified into three
categories: [Masquerader](202301021644.md)#, [Misfeasor](202301021648.md)#, and
[Clandestine User](202301021650.md)#.

Several attack methods could be tried by an Intruder to break into a system such
as *target acquisition and information gathering*, *initial access*, *privilege
escalation*, and *covering attacks*.

To penetrate a network, the Intruder will try to do a reconnaissance to locate
target's IP, #operating-system, and [port open](202206151841.md). They will then
run an exploit script to the open port, trying to gain access to the shell with
root privileges (`suid` user). The Intruder might download special versions of
system files granting them future access and circumventing CPU time and disk
storage space auditing.
