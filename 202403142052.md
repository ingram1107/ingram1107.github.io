# Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

DRAM cell contains 1 capacitor, where the transistor guard the state access and
the data line (DL) as output. The architecture is shown as below:

Despite DRAM cell is simpler and smaller than SRAM cell, the capacitor charges
decay which needs [constant recharge](202403142044.md) and this recharge can't
happen instantaneously, in which this phenomenon is called leakage. Data line
must connect to the amplifier for the data to be recognised by the computer.

**Note**: The number of address lines directly affect the cost of memory
controller, DRAM module, and DRAM chip.

When measuring the performance of a DRAM module, we have to consider several
constraints such as $t_{RCD}$ ($\overline{RAS}$-to-$\overline{CAS}$ delay), $CL$
($\overline{CAS}$ latency, which depends on the memory controller's quality),
$t_{RP}$ (row precharge time), and $t_{RAS}$ (delay of $\overline{RAS} before it
can precharge another row). Note that precharge command can't be issued right
away as it needs to wait for the data line to finish its job, thus the need of
$t_{RP}$. All discussed factors reduce the effective data rate of the DRAM
module.

**Note**: $t_{RAS}$ is usually 2 times or 3 times longer than $t_{RP}$.

A memory chip may consist of multiple banks which each contain rows, which each
contain columns. Each of them has their own individual timing constraint, and
because of their layout in the memory chip, it renders concurrent access to RAM
possible.

Hardware or software prefetching can be used to create more overlap in timing
and reduce stall in CPU cycles while waiting to read the cell.

There are several types of DRAM module:
- [Single Data Rate SDRAM (SDR SDRAM)](202403142202.md)
- [Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM)](202403150636.md)
- [Fully Buffered DRAM (FB-DRAM)](202403150846.md)
