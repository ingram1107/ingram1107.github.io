# Relational Algebra

Relational algebra has two kinds of operations: **unary operation** (on a single
relation) and **binary operation** (on two relations). Note that the operation
done on the relation is in the assumption that the relation is a
[Set](202204281446.md), that is no duplicated tuples are allowed. A constant
relation is expressed in the form $\{ (\text{tuple}), (\text{tuple}) \ldots \}$.
There is, however, no subquery construct in relational algebra unlike in
[Structured Query Language (SQL)](202302231241.md).

The unary operations are *selection* (denoted $\sigma$), *projection* (denoted
$\Pi$), and *rename* (denoted $\rho$). Selection in relational algebra is
equivalent to the `where` clause in [Structured Query Language (SQL)](202302231241.md)
and projection is equivalent to the `select` query, that is showing the
attributes from all matching tuples in a relation. The rename operation is often
used for naming relation in the expression. Valid comparison operators for
selection are $=$, $\not =$, $<$, $\le$, $>$, $\ge$, $\land$, $\lor$, and
$\lnot$. An example of relational expression to find the instructors that have
not the largest salary in the relation `instructor` is shown as below:

$$
\Pi_{\text{instructor.salary}}(\sigma_{\text{instructor.salary} <
\text{d.salary}}(\text{instructor} \times \rho_{d}(\text{instructor})))
$$

The binary operations are *set difference* (denoted $-$),
[Cartesian Product](202204281601.md) (denoted $\times$), *union* (denoted
$\cup$), *set intersection* (denoted $\cap$), *natural join* (denoted $\Join$),
*theta join* (denoted $\Join_{\theta}$), *assignment* (denoted $\leftarrow$) and
*outer join*. The binary operations work like normal operators in mathematical
sense, that sit between two relations to compute the result. Besides the
fundamental operations like set difference, Cartesian product, and union, most
binary operations can be expressed in fundamental operations like the following:

$$
\begin{align}
r \cap s &= r - (r - s)\\
r \Join s &= \Pi_{R \cup S}(\sigma_{r \cdot A_1 = s \cdot A_1 \land r \cdot A_2
= s \cdot A_2 \land \ldots r \cdot A_n = s \cdot A_n}(r \times s))\\
r \Join_{\theta} s &= \sigma_{\theta}(r \times s)\\
r \textbf{ left outer join } s &= r \Join s \cup (r - \Pi_R(r \Join s)) \times
\{(\text{null}, \ldots, \text{null})\}
\end{align}
$$

The union of two sets requires both to be *compatible*, that is both be of the
same arity (number of attributes) and same domain range of $i$th attribute of
both. Natural join operation will form a Cartesian product of two relations,
perform a selection forcing equality on the attributes that appear in both
relations, and then remove all duplicate attributes. Furthermore, natural join
is associative, i.e., $r \Join (s \Join v) = (r \Join s) \Join v$. Theta join
is basically a shorthand for selection on a Cartesian product. Outer join on the
other hand is like natural join but preserves the tuples from certain relation
that have null values depending on the types of outer join. The left outer join
preserves the left relation (left operand), the right outer join preserves the
right relation (right operand), and the full outer join preserves the both
relations (left and right operand). Assignment can be used to assign a relation
algebra expression to a temporary relation variable without executing it (no
concern on database modification).

There are also extended relation algebra operations that can't be expressed in
basic relational algebra operations. For example, generalised-projection and
aggregation operation. The former allows the use of data type specific operation
on the attributes' domain whereas the latter can perform aggregate function like
in the [SQL Transaction Control](202303011857.md) (sum, avg, count, min, max,
count-distinct etc.). Their mathematical forms are shown below:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Generalised-Projection }:& \Pi_{F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n}(E)\\
\text{Aggregation }:& _{G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n}\mathcal{G}_{F_1(A_1), F_2(A_2),
\ldots, F_m(A_m)}(E)
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n$ are the data type specific operations done on the
  attributes
- $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n$ are a list of attributes on which to group
- $F_1(A_1), F_2(A_2), \ldots, F_m(A_m)$ are a list of aggregate function.
