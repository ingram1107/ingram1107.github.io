# Modular Arithmetic

Modular Arithmetic defines an operator called **modulo operator**, denoted as $b
\mod n$. The result will be the *remainder* $a$ of $b$ divided by $n$. In modulo
world, we will only concern about integers, $\mathbb{Z}$.

Two numbers, $a$ and $b$ is said to be congruent, if $a$ and $b$ has the same
remainder when divided by $n$. For example, -10 and 12 is congruent if the
modulo $n$ is 11, since they have the same remainder, which is 1. This is
denoted as the following equation:

$$
a \equiv b \mod n
$$

Which could also be written as:

$$
a = qn + b
$$

A congruence modulo has several properties, shown as below:

$$
\begin{align}
a &\equiv b \mod n \text{ if } n | (a - b)\\
a &\equiv b \mod n \text{ implies } b \equiv a \mod n\\
a &\equiv b \mod n \text{ and } b \equiv c \mod n \text{ imply } a \equiv c \mod n
\end{align}
$$

We could get the next in line congruent residue by [Modulo Reduction](202210092136.md)#.
Based on this, we could do addition and multiplication, then modulo reduce the
answer when doing Modular Arithmetic with any group of integers (that is
[Set](202204281446.md)# $\mathbb{Z}_n = \{ 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1 \}$).
Additionally, the largest number in Modular Arithmetic (take note on doing
addition and multiplication) would be $n -1$ as it is a *clock arithmetic*.
There are some properties of Modular Arithmetic that need to take note:
- If $(a + b) = (a + c) \mod n$, then $b = c \mod n$.
- If $(a \cdot b) = (a \cdot c) \mod n$, then $b = c \mod n$ if and only if $a$
  is [relatively prime](202210092214.md)# to $n$.

The following shows the example of Modulo 8:

| +   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| 1   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 0   |
| 2   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 0   | 1   |
| 3   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   |
| 4   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   |
| 5   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| 6   | 6   | 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 7   | 7   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 5   | 5   | 6   |

**Note**: The #[inverse](202210082221.md) of the $a$ could be found in the table
by finding the matched row or column with value 0. For example, in the column
$4$, the value 0 appear in the row $4$, thus $4$ is the inverse of $4$ in modulo
8.

**Note**: We could substitute $a$ as $a \mod n$ at any point.
