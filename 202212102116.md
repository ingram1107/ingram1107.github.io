# El Gamal Encryption

El Gamal is a variant of [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](202209012218.md)# based
on the difficulty of [Discrete Logarithms (DLOG)](202210232232.md)# problem
invented by El Gamal in 1985[^elgamal]. It consists of three components: key
generation, encryption, and decryption.

Key generation is done first by selecting a random large prime number $p$ so
that calculating DLOG for it will be hard. Compute a generator $g$ from $Z_p^*$,
then pick a random number $x$, which would be the private key, from $Z_{p-1}$.
Compute $y = g^x \mod p$. The public key will be $(p, g, y)$.

To encrypt the message $M$ into ciphertext $C$, first select a random number $k$
from $Z_{p-1}$, then compute the ciphertext $C = (c_1, c_2)$ where $c_1 = g^k
\mod p$ and $c_2 = My^k \mod p$.

To decrypt, apply the formula $M = c_2/c_1^x \mod p = c_2 (c_1^x)^{-1} \mod p$
or $M = c_2 c_1^{p-1-x} \mod p$ to avoid the calculation of [multiplicative inverse](202210082303.md)#.

However, the above algorithm is not safe from [CCA](202212102155.md)#.
