# Bus Network

Bus network is a [Network Topology](202304211303.md) with a single communication
path (bus) that connects all [Network Devices](202207051821.md). All data
transmission will be duplex and happen on a single bus. In all
non-[wireless](202303301607.md) network topology, this is the most
cost-effective network design that an organisation can choose as it uses less
cable length than all cabled topologies. [10BASE2 cable](202302161846.md) is the
most economic cable available for the bus topology, combining with
[Repeater](202207051832.md), it is cheap and easy to extend a network.
