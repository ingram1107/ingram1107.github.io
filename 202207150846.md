# Circuit Switching

Circuit Switching is a #[Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) technology that
allows private connection from multiple sites to a single carrier's switched
network in order to communicate with each other. This can be done by using a
[physical switch](202207051907.md)#. The resources needed along a path
(end-to-end dedicated line between two end systems) to provide for communication
between end systems are reserved for the duration of the communication session.
It is originated from telephone network.

The bandwidth of a circuit switched network can be [Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md)
or [Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)](202209091302.md) to divide a link's
bandwidth for multiple users. That being said, the unused bandwidth can't be
utilised by circuit switching which lead to idle bandwidth utilised unlike in
[Packet Switching](202207150848.md).

Though [redundant](202210012123.md) circuits are possible with Circuit
Switching, only one user could be in the circuit which the circuits are
separated for each call, and only one path could be selected per call.

Some Circuit Switching implementations are shown below:
- [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)#
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)#
