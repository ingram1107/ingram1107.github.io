# Circuit Switching

Circuit Switching is a #[Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) technology that
allows private connection from multiple sites to a single carrier's switched
network in order to communicate with each other. This can be done by using a
[physical switch](202207051907.md)#. It is originated from telephone network.

Though [redundant](202210012123.md) circuits are possible with Circuit
Switching, only one user could be in the circuit which the circuits are
separated for each call, and only one path could be selected per call.

Some Circuit Switching implementations are shown below:
- [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)#
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)#
