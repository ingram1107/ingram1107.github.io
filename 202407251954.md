# Client-Intercept-Server Model

Client-intercept-server model deploys intercept-agent in the form of
[Protocol](202209302229.md) between the client-side agent and the server-side
agent, which minimise the communication cost via #caching, differencing, header
reduction, and/or single [HTTP](202202211439.md) connection per session.

**Note**: Caching at the client-side allow the usage of local data access
technologies such as ADO.NET or SQL Server Compact (CE).

Example of its implementation including:
- IBM Web Express
