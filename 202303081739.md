# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

IDS is a method of [Intrusion Detection](202301031034.md) analyses data in real
time to detect, log and hinder (block the traffic) misuse and
[attacks](202209261358.md). There are two kinds of IDS: host-based IDS and
network-based IDS. The former examines server operation for any harmful events,
whereas the latter monitors network traffic, by looking for known attack
signatures at packets, on a specific portion of the network.

IDS performs **passive monitoring**, that is analysed a copied route on the
network to the IDS sensor. If there is a matched intrusion signature, the sensor
will send an alarm to the management console. Note that the rouge packet still
reach the intended target.
