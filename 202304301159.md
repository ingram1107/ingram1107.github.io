# Vertical Integration

In business aspect, vertical integration is viewed as a method of [System Integration (SI)](202303242149.md)
that effectively link between upstream and downstream business structures by
coordinating hierarchies for effective task execution for which they are jointly
responsible. Often, the company deploys this method to take over another
companies at different stage on the same production path.

From system perspective, vertical integration is defined as an attempt to
integrate data, functionalities, and processes at different levels (a hierarchy)
of an #organisation in a new way. In other words, it integrates subsystems
according to their functionalities by grouping them as [silos](202304301204.md).
Short term wise, this method of integration is cheap as it could be performed
quickly, and only necessary vendors are involved due to the nature of silo.
However, the cost-of-ownership is much higher when comparing to other kinds of
SI methods in the case of functionality expansion. This is because silo might
not interact well with other silo, resulting the need of implementing another
silo in order to scale the system, thus increasing the overall costs.
