# Cisco Switch Configuration

To configure [Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)# with
[Switch](202207051907.md)#, there is a need to set up an [IP Address](202206281021.md),
[subnet mask](202206280939.md), and default gateway (router to direct switch
management traffic for remote access such as Telnet and [Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md))
in a switch. The configuration could be done in [IOS](202210012232.md)# with the
command `vlan {number}` in Interface Configuration Mode follows by the IP
address assigned to the VLAN. Define the VLAN membership mode for the assigned
interface (port) with `switchport mode access` and assign VLAN to it by
`switchport access vlan {number}` in the Interface Configuration Mode.

**Note**: Remember to run `no shutdown` on the VLAN interface to keep it alive.

The default gateway could be set with the command `ip default-gateway
{router-ip-addr}` in Global Configuration Mode.
