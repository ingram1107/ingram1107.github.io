# Cisco Switch Configuration

To configure #[Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md) with
[Switch](202207051907.md)#, there is a need to set up an [IP Address](202206281021.md),
[subnet mask](202206280939.md), and default gateway (router to direct switch
management traffic for remote access such as Telnet and [Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md))
in a switch. The configuration could be done in [IOS](202210012232.md)# with the
command `vlan {number}` in Interface Configuration Mode follows by the IP
address assigned to the VLAN. We can attach a name to a VLAN by simply running
the command `name {vlan-name}` right after `vlan {number}` command in Global
Configuration Mode. Define the VLAN membership mode for the assigned interface
(port) as `access` (see [Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)](202212182202.md)# for
other possible modes) with `switchport mode {mode}` and assign VLAN to it by
`switchport access vlan {number}` in the Interface Configuration Mode.

**Note**: Remember to run `no shutdown` on the VLAN interface to keep it alive.

**Note**: The VLAN membership mode should be set as `access` on all ports that
the network administrator doesn't want them to be a trunk port.

**Note**: If two switches can support both ISL and [IEEE 802.1Q](202212251358.md),
there is a need to run `switchport trunk encapsulation {trunk-protocol}` (value
can be `dot1q` or `isl`) before `switchport mode trunk`.

Configuring a VLAN to be native VLAN for trunk links could be done by executing
the command `switchport trunk native vlan {vlan-number}` in Interface
Configuration Mode.

The default gateway could be set with the command `ip default-gateway
{router-ip-addr}` in Global Configuration Mode, which could be used for
administration purpose to ping another device in other network.

We can define the switch as the primary root bridge for
[Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)](202207081637.md)# for the VLANs running the
command `spanning-tree vlan {vlan-numbers} root primary` in Global Configuration
Mode.

**Note**: Replace `primary` with `secondary` if you want to set the switch as a
secondary root bridge instead.

To enter the forwarding state immediately (i.e. bypassing listening and learning
states) on a port, run the command `spanning-tree portfast` in Interface
Configuration Mode. However, PortFast is only enabled in non-trunking ports to
prevent [Network Loop](202207081644.md)#. Generally speaking, it is recommended
to only enable PortFast on the link that connects end station and the switch. To
prevent possible network loop on non-trunking ports that has PortFast enabled,
run `spanning-tre bpduguard enable` in Interface Configuration Mode. If the port
received bridge protocol data units (BPDU, used to exchange switch's
information) with the BPDU Guard on, PortFast will be immediately terminated so
that the switch wouldn't have an invalid configuration.
