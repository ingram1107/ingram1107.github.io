# Cisco Switch Configuration

To configure #[Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md) with
[Switch](202207051907.md)#, there is a need to set up an [IP Address](202206281021.md),
[subnet mask](202206280939.md), and default gateway (router to direct switch
management traffic for remote access such as Telnet and [Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md))
in a switch. The configuration could be done in [IOS](202210012232.md)# with the
command `vlan {number}` in Interface Configuration Mode follows by the IP
address assigned to the VLAN. We can attach a name to a VLAN by simply running
the command `name {vlan-name}` right after `vlan {number}` command in Global
Configuration Mode. Define the VLAN membership mode for the assigned interface
(port) with `switchport mode {mode}` (available value are `access` for access
mode, and `trunk` for [trunk mode](202212251342.md)#) and assign VLAN to it by
`switchport access vlan {number}` in the Interface Configuration Mode.

**Note**: Remember to run `no shutdown` on the VLAN interface to keep it alive.

**Note**: The VLAN membership mode should be set as `access` on all ports that
the network administrator doesn't want them to be a trunk port.

**Note**: If two switches can support both ISL and [IEEE 802.1Q](202212251358.md),
there is a need to run `switchport trunk encapsulation {trunk-protocol}` (value
can be `dot1q` or `isl`) before `switchport mode trunk`.

The default gateway could be set with the command `ip default-gateway
{router-ip-addr}` in Global Configuration Mode, which could be used for
administration purpose to ping another device in other network.
