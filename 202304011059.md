# User Requirements Specification (URS)

URS, aka User Requirements Document (URD), outlines the [user expectation](202303251303.md)
of the [System](202303242148.md). This includes [Functional Requirement](202303251342.md)
and [Nonfunctional Requirement (NFR)](202303251345.md). Though functional
requirement could be documented in separate document, Functional Requirements
Specification (FRS).
