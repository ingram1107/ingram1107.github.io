# Entity

An entity is a representation of a concrete or an abstract object in real life
that has properties, sometimes called attributes, that one or some of them may
uniquely identify it. We can collect them into an [Entity Set](202304191956.md).
Entity may have a role or function plays in a [Relationship](202304192107.md),
typically implicitly. There is a scenario where explicit roles are needed when
the same [Entity Set](202304191956.md) participants in the same [Relationship Set](202304200933.md)
more than once in different roles (typically called a recursive relationship
set).
