# Linux's Storage Management

#[202204081225](202204081225.md) usually treat [PATA](202202041659.md) and [SATA](202202041834.md) disks as if
they are [SCSI](202202041945.md) devices.

The naming convention for mounted devices is as follows:
- `/dev/sdx` for hard drives
- `/dev/stx` and `/dev/nstx` for SCSI tapes
- `/dev/scdx` or `/dev/srx` for SCSI CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs

## Quota

**Note**: For Arch Linux users, install `quota-tools` to have the tools for
below.

Linux could enable [202202201324](202202201324.md) support for a specific drive by adding the
options `usrquota` and/or `grpquota` into the file `/etc/fstab`. Runs `quotaon`
afterwards to turn on the quota on specified file system. Note that it is
advised that running these operations on unmount drive.

After mounting the drive, create the quote index by calling `quotacheck` which
will create 2 files: `aquota.user` and `aquota.group` using the option `-cug`.
(`c` as create, `u` as user, `g` as group)

**Note**: Linux kernel version 2.6.x or earlier could have troubles on quota
support.

To set quotas for specific user (or group using `-g`), use the command `edquota`
follow by the username. It will open the text editor which will show the
following contents:

```txt
Disk quotas for user (uid 21810):
Filesystem    blocks      soft      hard    inodes    soft    hard
/dev/sdc4      97104   1048576   1048576      1242       0       0
```

We can safely ignore `blocks` and `inodes` sections. The `soft` and `hard`
sections indicate the soft limit and hard limit for `blocks` and `inodes`
correspondingly.

Hard limit specifies the maximum consumable `blocks` or `inodes`, and the kernel
will not permit disk operations that could exceed this.

Soft limit specifies the consumed amount of `blocks` or `inodes` that will
trigger a warning on it. If the user stay on or beyond the soft limit for a
certain period (dictated by *grace period*), it will be treated as a hard limit.

To disable soft and/or hard limit, set it to 0. The grace period could be set by
using `edquota -t`.
