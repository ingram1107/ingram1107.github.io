# Data Model

Data Model is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data
relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. It provides a way to
describe the design of a [Database](202302101139.md) at
[physical, logical and view levels](202302101203.md). The final design of a data
model should satisfy the data and [Functional Requirements](202303251342.md) of
the application (interaction with the user is important), ensure no conflicts
between data, and describe the data and their relationship clearly.

There are phases on guiding the design of the data model, primarily
[conceptual design phase](202304191443.md), [Logical Design Phase](202304191453.md),
then [Physical Design Phase](202304191454.md).

Data Model can be categorised into four types:
- [Relational Model](202302101331.md)
- [Entity-Relationship Model](202302101334.md)
- [Object-Based Data Model](202302101336.md)
- [Semistructured Data Model](202302101339.md)
