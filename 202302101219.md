# Data Model

Data Model is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data
relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. It provides a way to
describe the design of a [Database](202302101139.md) at
[physical, logical and view levels](202302101203.md). The final design of a data
model should satisfy the data and funtional requirements, ensure no conflicts
between data, and describe the data and their relationship clearly.

During logical design phase, we shall map the conceptual schema, ideally with no
[redundant information](202302171903.md), to the data model implementation.
During physical design phase, we shall focus on the database physical
characteristics such as form of file organisation and internal storage struct.

Data Model can be categorised into four types:
- [Relational Model](202302101331.md)
- [Entity-Relationship Model](202302101334.md)
- [Object-Based Data Model](202302101336.md)
- [Semistructured Data Model](202302101339.md)
