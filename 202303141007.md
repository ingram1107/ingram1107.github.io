# NetBIOS

NetBIOS is a software interface invented by IBM originally for IBM PC Network
(include token ring) providing interface between programs and the actual
hardware on the interface card for personal computer. It works on the
[Transport Layer](202206131837.md). It provides four services:
- [name service](202303141012.md)
- [session service](202303141018.md)
- [datagram service](202303141021.md)
- [general commands](202303141023.md)

On top of NetBIOS, there is Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that works on
[Presentation Layer](202206131853.md).
