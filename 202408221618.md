# Security Control

Security control is an action taken or mechanism established to resolve
information assurance issues. Its implementation is driven by the urge to
protect critical and sensitive information assets, ensuring regulatory and
legislation compliance, to gain competitive edge, to mitigate risks, and to
avoid unnecessary losses. The selection of a security control is influenced by
the possibility of threat's occurrence and existing vulnerabilities.

When implementing a security control, we have to establish a balance between
risk management and control implementation, select and implement appropriate
controls, and do assessment and review on them.

We can classify security control in three groups:
- [Management Control](202408221623.md)
- [Operational Control](202408221625.md)
- [Technical Control](202408221627.md)

Within an [Information Assurance](202408141942.md) program, we can classify
security control according to *its level*:
- [Strategic Management Control](202408231513.md)
- [Tactical Management Control](202408231514.md)
- [Operational Management Control](202408231515.md)

**Note**: The formulation of strategic plan should be aided from different
perspective within the organisation.
