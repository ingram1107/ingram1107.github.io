# Random-Access Memory (RAM) Architecture

RAM could be designed as a [static RAM (SRAM)](202403181035.md) or
[dynamic RAM (DRAM)](202403142052.md).

**Note**: RAM die is the actual memory chip on the stick or DIMM.

Memories are transferred in the form of blocks, smaller than
[Cache](202403191017.md) line in size, from main memory to caches.
In the case of cache misses, the performance can be improved by the technique
[Critical Word First and Early Restart](202403292218.md).
