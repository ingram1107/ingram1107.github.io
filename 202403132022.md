# Random-Access Memory (RAM) Architecture

RAM could be designed as a static RAM (SRAM) or [dynamic RAM (DRAM)](202403142052.md).
A typical SRAM cell contains 6 transistors as shown in the following diagram:

SRAM requires constant power to maintain the cell states which is assessable
immediately once the word access line (WL) is raised. There is no need of
refreshing the charge.

DRAM cell contains 1 capacitor, where the transistor guard the state access and
the data line (DL) as output. The architecture is shown as below:

Despite DRAM cell is simpler and smaller than SRAM cell, the capacitor charges
decay which needs [constant recharge](202403142044.md) and this recharge can't
happen instantaneously, in which this phenomenon is called leakage. Data line
must connect to the amplifier for the data to be recognised by the computer.

**Note**: The number of address lines directly affect the cost of memory
controller, DRAM module, and DRAM chip.

**Note**: RAM die is the actual memory chip on the stick or DIMM.
