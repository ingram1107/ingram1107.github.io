# GNOME Display Manager (GDM)

GDM is the default #[202205182153](202205182153.md) for GNOME desktop environment. Its main
configuration file is `/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf` (older) or `/etc/gdm/custom.conf`
(newer).

To enable remote access to the #[202205182136](202205182136.md), set the option `enable` to
`yes` in the section `[xdmcp]` in the configuration file. If it appears to have
errors upon connecting to the client, change `DisallowTCP` from `true` to
`false` for older version or add in the line `DisallowTCP=false` under the
section `[security]`.
