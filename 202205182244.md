# KDE Display Manager (KDM)

KDM is usually the default #[202205182153](202205182153.md) for KDE desktop environment. The
configuration directory for it can be arbitrary, but the file itself is named
`kdmrc`.

To enable remote access to the #[202205182136](202205182136.md) server, set `Enable` to `true`
in the section `[Xdmcp]`. If there is an error upon remote connection to the
client, try to find a line of command that contains `-nolisten tcp` and remove
it.
