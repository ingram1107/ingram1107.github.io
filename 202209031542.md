# Dynamic Packet Transport (DPT)

DPT is an #[optical](202209021233.md) networking technology that utilises
[SONET](202209021758.md)/SDH framing and employs intelligent protection
switching in the event of fibre facility or node failure or signal degradation.
Electrical signals and light can be converted to each other form via Fibre-Optic
Transmission Systems (FOTS), whihc is a [Modulator](202209291044.md). It uses a
bidirectional, counterrotating ring structure for metro applications, and a star
structure with a central switching device for service point-to-point backbones.
