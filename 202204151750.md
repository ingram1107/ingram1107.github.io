# Span

`gsl::span` or in C++20 `std::span` is an object that hold a contiguous sequence
of objects which provide a range checking for primitive arrays that is not one
of the #[C++ Container](202202241719.md). It provides a range checking for them
where the size of the sequence is to be known at compile time. It deprecates the
use of either raw pointer or smart pointer in order to obtain a view on a
sequence of objects.
