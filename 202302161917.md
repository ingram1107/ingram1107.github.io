# Propagation Delay

Propagation delay is the time taken for a packet to propagate from the beginning
of the link to the destination [node](202207051821.md) or simply the [transmission media](202209271520.md).
It is calculated using the following formula:

$$
d_{\text{prop}} = \frac{\text{distance between two nodes}}{\text{propagation
speed}}
$$

As you can see from the equation, the propagation delay is directly proportional
to the distance between two nodes.
