# Radian and Degree

Derive from the following formulae that calculate the angle for the whole circle:

$$
\theta = \frac{s}{r} = \frac{2\pi r}{r} = 2\pi = 360\degree
$$

Where $s$ is the circumference of the circle, $r$ is the radius of the circle.

We know that $\pi = 180\degree$. The former is in radian, the latter is in degree. Both express the same idea, just in different units. Therefore, it is quite easy to convert them interchangeably.
