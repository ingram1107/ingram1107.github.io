# Leaky Bucket Algorithm

Leaky bucket algorithm is one of the algorithms of [Traffic Shaping](202302201414.md)
enforcing a constant output rate regardless of input rate which results in a
uniform flow of packets. If the [buffer overflows](202209302245.md), then
packets are discarded. It is implemented as a single-server queue with constant
service time.

It is preferable if the packet size is constant or fixed. If the underlying
[network layer protocol](202206131702.md) supports only variable-length packets,
we can implement the algorithm by allowing a fixed number of bytes per clock
tick.
