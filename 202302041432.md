# Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

DPI is a technique allowing network security devices such as
[Firewall](202301211140.md) to inspect [IP](202206151238.md) packet's content
beyond just the packet header. By that, the network can distinguish one
application from another, and based on that, it can increase or drop the
priority for that application on using network bandwidth. However, DPI may
result in false positives, miscategorising, and dropping the wrong traffic.
