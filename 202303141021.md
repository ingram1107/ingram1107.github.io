# NetBIOS Datagram Service

[NetBIOS](202303141007.md) datagram service provides connectionless and
unreliable networking service like [UDP](202206151759.md). It only needs a
[name](202303141012.md) (either local or remote) for sending or receiving
message to or from a process. In other cases, there is no need a name and
instead can broadcast the datagram to other nodes.
