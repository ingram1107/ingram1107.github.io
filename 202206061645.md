# HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

HCL is a declarative configuration language developed by HashiCorp where `.tf`
is its well known file extension. It is mainly used in HashiCorp products such
as #[HashiCorp Terraform](202205041220.md). It is one of the good example of
[domain language](lit/@Hunt1999.md). The general syntax is looked like below:

```hcl
resource "local_file" "my_file" {
  content = "Hello World"
  filename = "/root/hello_world"
}
```

The above example specify a `resource` **block** with **parameters** of
`local_file` and `my_file`. Defined within the block scope is what will be
passed as **arguments** to the according `resource` [plugin](202206072154.md)#.
Generally speaking, the block will contain the information about the
infrastructure platform and resources from that infrastructure platform.
