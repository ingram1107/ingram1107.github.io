# Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

OSI model is an open standard for architectural framework for networking and
data communication. Defined by the [International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](202210010830.md)
community, it has *7 layers* which are collectively referred to as a #stack.
These 7 layers, from low to high, are:

1. [Physical Layer](202206131647.md)#
2. [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)#
3. [Network Layer](202206131702.md)#
4. [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)#
5. [Session Layer](202206131849.md)#
6. [Presentation Layer](202206131853.md)#
7. [Application Layer](202206131856.md)#

Information are passed in [Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)#.

Using OSI Model has several advantages: easier protocol design (as it will
operate at a specific and defined interface to the layers above and below),
fosters competition, isolates effects of changes in one layer, and a common
language which defines networking functions and capabilities.
