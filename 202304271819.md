# IEEE 802.15

IEEE 802.15 is a working group that develops consensus standards for
[Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)](202303292149.md) which publishes
standards and recommended practices. It also deals with issues of
[coexistence](202304271759.md) and interoperability with other
[wireless](202303301607.md) and wireline technologies.

IEEE 802.15.1 specifies standard for [WPAN/Bluetooth](202304212236.md) in
[Physical Layer](202206131647.md) and [MAC layer](202303301623.md) which
licensed from Bluetooth SIG, Inc. IEEE 802.15.2 considers coexistence mechanism
proposals. IEEE 802.15.2 specifies WPAN High Rate (200 Mbps) such as IEEE
802.15.3A Ultra Wideband (UWB).

In IEEE 802.15.4 specifies WPAN Low Rate including its protocol architecture
([PHY Layer](202206131647.md) and [MAC layer](202303301623.md)) for
[ZigBee](202304271806.md). In PHY layer, it specifies at least 5 mW transmit
power and at most 85 dBm (decibel-milliwatts, a unit for power measurement)
receiver sensitivity in 2.4 GHz band. This includes technologies such as
receiver energy detection (ED) and link quality indication (LQI). In MAC layer,
it categorises devices into full function device (FFD) and reduced function
device (RFD). FFD can work with any [Network Topology](202304211303.md),
function as a network coordinator, and talk to any other devices in the network.
RFD is limited to [Star Network](202304211316.md), and can't be a network
coordinator. Furthermore, three security levels are specified in MAC layer
including [Access Control](202210022203.md) lists, data freshness timer, and the
use of [128-Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md) encryption.
