# Optical Carrier (OC)

OC is the equivalent standard of [Synchronous Transport Signal (STS)](202304041958.md)
for optical signals propagated across the [fibre](202209021233.md). Its data
rate can be referred to [Synchronous Transport Signal (STS)](202304041958.md).

OC standard with a suffix of C, called OC Concatenated, has no inverse
[Multiplexing](202209091259.md) mechanic. For example, OC-3 can be 3 OC-1
multiplexed together or a single OC-3C. It provides more flexibility and doesn't
have a need for inverse multiplexing equipment.
