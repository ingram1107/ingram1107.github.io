# Question of Socialism

Q: It seems like the [feudal state](202202251419.md) did not necessarily oppress
its immediate threats, serfs. Rather, continue its oppression on the slaves like
their ancient counterpart. This is rather different from what
[@VladimirLenin1918](lit/@VladimirLenin1918.md) wrote.

A: The oppressed class in feudal state is not necessarily serfs. They could be
anyone that is being oppressed by the [state apparatus](202204202040.md), call it
slaves or someone who are label as worthless or inferior. It is still undeniable
that those class antagonisms exist albeit taking into another form.
