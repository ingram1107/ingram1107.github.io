# Cloud Forensic

Cloud forensic is the application of [Digital Forensic](202311281800.md)
principles and procedures in a cloud-computing environment to establish facts
about civil, administrative, or criminal allegations. The procedures can be
varied by on the cloud model employed by the provider. For examples,
[Software as a Service (SaaS)](202304161334.md) and [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](202310311815.md)
allows imposing limited control for investigators to monitor process of network.
[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](202310311819.md) allows sufficient control
to deploy a forensic-friendly logging mechanism on the infrastructure.

Tracking criminal activities can be difficult in cloud environment as the cloud
security is not transparent to the investigators. Factors such as multitenant
and [Virtualisation](202311161439.md) make it difficult to prevent and
investigate cloud-based crimes and attacks on clouds and their users as their
integrity and trace may not be preserved after used. Other challenges include
*cloud data storage* (volatile data and multitenancy), *trustworthiness of
evidence*, *forensics data acquisition* (physical inaccessibility, less control,
decentralised log information), *forensics data organisation* (alteration of
system clock, absence of critical information in logs), *legal issues* ([chain of custody](202311281822.md),
crime scene reconstruction, cross border law, presentation), and *regulatory and
compliance issues*.
