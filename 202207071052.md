# Hierarchical Network

Networks could divide [Router](202207061800.md) or [Switch](202207051907.md)
into several [logical grouping](202207071149.md)#. In turn, this simplifies the
routing updates as they will be confined within the grouping, and drastically
reduces the traffic overhead. Notice its similarity to [VLAN](202207061741.md).

Although Hierarchical Network is a good idea for network design, we should be
aware of the **network diameter** (number of devices that a packet need to cross
before reaching its destination), **bandwidth/link aggregation**, and
**redundancy**. If the network diameter is too large, it will introduce high
latency for the communication. The advice is to have a predictable number of
hops between the source and destination devices.

A well-designed Hierarchical Network is scalable, redundant, highly performant,
secure, manageable and easier to maintain.
