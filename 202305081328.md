# Frequency Reuse Pattern

Frequency reuse pattern is the closest distance between centres of 2
[cells](202303292214.md) using the same frequency in different clusters. It is
determined by the choice of the **cluster size** $C$ and the layout of the cell
cluster. For hexagonal cells, we can calculate $C$ with the following formula:

$$
C = i^2 + ij + j^2
$$

Where both $i$ and $j$ represent the relative distance between [Cochannel Cells](202304031912.md).
$i$ represents the straight line whereas $j$ represents the diagonal line.

Frequency reuse is important as a method apply on nearby cells to avoid
interference or cross-talking between adjacent cells with different frequencies.
Each cell will be assigned 10 to 50 frequencies, and the transmission power is
controlled to limit power at that frequency escaping to adjacent cells. However,
we have to determine how many cells must intervene between two cells using the
same frequency.
