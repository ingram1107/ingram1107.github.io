# Docker Volume

#[202203251354](202203251354.md) stores its volume or storage under the directory
/var/lib/docker/volume. Such volume could be created using the command `docker
volume create`.

Docker could attach a Docker Volume or an external directory to a
[202203281423](202203281423.md) using the option `-v` in `docker run. Attaching a Docker Volume
to a container is call **volume mount** with the format `{volume-name}/{path}`
whereas attaching an external directory to a container is call **bind mount**
`{dir-path}/{path}`.

For it to be more verbose, we could specify it with the `--mount` option like
`--mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql` where `type`
specify what is the type of mounting is using, `source` specify the volume name
or the external directory path depending on the mount type and `target` specify
the targeted path where the data stored.

There are a variety of storage drivers that Docker supported: aufs, ZFS, btrfs,
Device Mapper, Overlay and Overlay2. See more in [202202060057](202202060057.md).
