# Usability Testing

Usability Testing aims to test the [usability](202303242139.md) of the software,
that is about the user interface, user performance on that interface, and [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md)
while using the program from the end-user point of view under real or simulated
environment. As the testing is done regarding the user, it puts most of the
concerns in terms of human factors rather than relying on synthetic data
collected elsewhere, which by some sense quite similar to
[Validation and Verification of System Requirements](202206201346.md). It could
be done by recording the user interaction with the product and involves them in
questionnaires and interviews on user satisfaction. It is especially important
for development of standard products that have to go through several
generations. The end result of the testing should be a consistent interface in
navigation structure, use of terms, and system responses to user [interaction](202303242118.md).
#[Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md) recommends doing them as early
as possible.
