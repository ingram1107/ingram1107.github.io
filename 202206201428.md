# Usability Testing

Usability Testing aims to test the usability of the software, that is about the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) while using the program from the end-user point of view under real environment. As the testing is done regarding the user, it puts most of the concerns in terms of human factors rather than relying on synthetic data collected elsewhere, which by some sense quite similar to [202206201346](202206201346.md). #[202206201159](202206201159.md) recommends doing them as early as possible.
