# Subnetting

Subnetting is a networking technique used to separate hosts within a network
which involves sliding a portion of the #[host bits](202206280922.md). The
network that doesn't implement this technique is called a **flat network**.

[Router](202207061800.md) uses the *subnet mask* (32-bit number in the same
format to #[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)) to distinguish the network, the
subnet and the host address space. It has a consecutive 1s starting from the
most significant bits (MSB) followed by 0s. The former represents the network
bits, the latter shows the host bits. Currently, there are two ways to do
subnetting:
- [Fix-Length Subnet Masking](202210152323.md)#
- [Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)](202210162049.md)#

It provides several advantages compare to not using it:
- improve the bandwidth usage
- minimised #[Collision Domain](202207051805.md)
