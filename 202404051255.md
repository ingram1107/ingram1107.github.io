# Digital Signal Processors (DSP)

DSP targets high-data-rate computation tasks. It implements #algorithm in
hardware and is best in repetitive and numerically intensive task. DSP is
measured to be 2 to 3 times faster than [Microprocessor](202404051142.md).
However, it generally lacks adequate compiler support.

Most DSPs employ [Harvard Architecture](202404051155.md).
