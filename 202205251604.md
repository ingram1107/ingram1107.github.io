# Git Relative Positioning

Symbols such as `^` and `~` could be used for relative positioning for
#[Git HEAD](202204261252.md). It could be applied to HEAD itself, branch name or
tag, but **not to individual commit**.

`^` means moving up to one commit or its nearest parent from the current commit.
If followed by number, let's say $x$, it will point to the $x$th parent of the
commit in the Git [DAG](202204112118.md). You can visualise it in `git log
--graph`. This could be useful when dealing with repository that use
#[Git Merge](202204261123.md) often.

`~{#}` means moving up along the commit in a *linear sense*. This means that it
will always prioritise the nearest parent of the commit. If number is not
specified, it behaves the same with `^`. Otherwise, it will move up $x$-th times
linearly along the commit history.
