# Estimated Effective Delay

Estimated effective delay could be calculated with the following mathematical
formula:

$$
D = \frac{D_0}{(1 - U)}
$$

Where:
- $D_0$ is the delay when the network is idle
- $U$ is the ratio (value between 0 and 1) denoting the current bandwidth
  utilisation.

From the equation we could know that if there is an increase on the bandwidth
utilisation, that is when the [Throughput](202304111957.md) has increased, the
delay will experience an increase too. For example, if the current bandwidth
utilisation is approaching 1, then the result of $1 - U$ will close to 0, then
$D$ will be infinity or too large to be estimated. In truth, the delay will
exponentially increase when the network approaches its full throughput capacity.

To keep the estimated effective delay down, one would try to keep the network
utilisation low by adding the [Network Capacity](202304191208.md) once the
average or peak utilisation reaches a preset threshold. Such threshold value is
usually set conservatively.
