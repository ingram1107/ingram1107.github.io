# Collision Domain

A Collision Domain is a *network segment* which consists of two or more devices that share the same medium. This resulted in a competition for resources (e.g. bandwidth) and in turn makes a collision possible as there can be simultaneous transmission from two or more devices.

The logical solution to it is to reduce the size of the segment, that is, split the segment into smaller one. Since the lesser the users within a network, the less likely such collision will happen. Additionally, it allows the segment to have more bandwidth as it doesn't interfere with other segments.

There are several ways to implement the solution:
