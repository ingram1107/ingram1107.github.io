# Higher-Order Function (HOF)

HOF is a function that takes other function(s) as argument(s) or returns a
function (anything that is callable including object's method). It is
particularly useful in [Functional Programming](202203061121.md) to eliminate
[code duplication](202206171004.md) when comparing to the use of pure
[Lambda](202203231113.md). Essentially, we could say that HOF is a wrapper for a
generic lambda such as $f1(f2(x))$ and $f1 \land f2 \land \ldots$.

When constructing a HOF in [C++](202302190651.md), it is the best practice to
stick with the `auto` return type for the lambda return over the `std::function`
to the [Compiler](202302152015.md) optimises the code. The first concern is the
latter has #performance penalty, second it doesn't support string equality
comparison implicitly.[^fahller2018] That being said, there is an overload
concern over HOF in C++ as the compiler can't know which function to choose as
it is too late to analyse it. The solution is either with generic lambda (of
course introduces code duplication) or macro LIFT (shown below). There are
libraries like boost::hof [^gh-boost-hof] and rollbear's lift
library[^gh-rollbear-lift] that support the macro LIFT.

```cpp
#define LIFT(f)                                     \
[](auto&& ... p)                                    \
{                                                   \
    return f(std::forward<decltype(p)>(p) ...));    \
}
```
