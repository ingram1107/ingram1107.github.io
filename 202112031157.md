# Stack

Stack is a kind of data structure that insertions and deletions only performed
at the top of its structure. It is **LIFO** by design which is in contrast with
[Queue](202112101836.md). It could be implemented in [list](202112031205.md)# or
[array](202112031221.md)#.

Stack can be used for:
- balancing symbols
- postfix expressions which could result in O(N)
- infix to postfix conversion which could result in O(N)
- function call

## Attention

- Push, the insertion on Stack, need to detect out of space as an
  implementation error
- Pop, the deletion on Stack, and Top, to view most recently inserted element
  need to detect empty stack as an ADT error
