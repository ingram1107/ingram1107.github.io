# Screened-Subnet Firewall System

Screened-Subnet Firewall System is the most secure [Firewall](202301211140.md)
configuration where two [Packet-Filtering Routers](202301221147.md) are used. It
allows the creation of an isolated sub-network. This establishes three layers of
defence that could thwart most [Intruders](202301021642.md). These two routers
has different roles. The outside router advertises only the existence of the
screened subnet to the Internet so that the internal network is invisible to the
Internet. The inside router advertises only the existence of the screened subnet
to the internal network so that the systems on the inside network cannot
construct direct routes to the Internet.
