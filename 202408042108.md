# Caching In Multithread Environment

In multihreading environment, there are closely-linked aspects that play
important role on optimising [CPU Cache](202403191017.md) performance, which are
[Concurrency](202202011815.md), atomicity, and bandwidth. We will look into
these aspects individually at below sections.

**Note**: Advices in multithread environment can be applied to multiprocess
environment too, just so we have to distinguish [Differences between Parallelism and Concurrency](202202011649.md).

## Concurrency

Some cache optimisations may be bad for concurrency. An example for this is
elaborated in [Cache Access Optimisation](202407191014.md) where we group common
data into a single structure. Though the data is shared among threads through
caches, it will generate a lot of request-for-ownership (RFO), each contributes
a write access, due to the cache line's ["E" state](202403271116.md) (exclusive)
as multiple write happen to the same memory location. This phenomenon is known
as **false sharing** (Drepper).

The solution is to have separate cache line for the same data for processors,
but this could come at the cost of increasing program's footprint. Drepper
developed two criteria on evaluating which kind of variable should have to be
individually owned or cached by processors: mutability and its frequency.

For constant variable (`const`), it will be shared in "S" state, so grouping
constant variables is fine. GCC compiler usually moved them into `.rodata` or
`.data.rel.ro` section.

If the variable is only ever used by one thread, we can define it as a
thread-local variable with GCC's specifier `__thread`. Such variable is
addressable by other threads via a passing pointer provided by the owner, though
they can't find it in global address space. Thread-local variable comes with the
downsides of increasing thread initialisation cost, higher addressing cost, and
higher resource cost (DSO allocation triggered when variable is used as memory
for all other thread-local variables are packed into the same object). Another
problem of using thread-local variable is that current value in the old thread
is not available to the new one if the variable is shifted to the new thread
since the copy of the variable is distinct. This can be solved through
coordination.

The general advice, by Drepper, except those that are mentioned above, is to
group read-write data that is often used together into a single structure like
in [Cache Access Optimisation](202407191014.md). Move those read-write variables
that are frequently written by different threads onto their own cache line, with
the compilation flag `-fms-extensions`. Variables that are used by multiple
thread, but each use is independent, should be moved into thread-local storage
(TLS).
