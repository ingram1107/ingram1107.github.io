# Defence in Depth

Defence in depth is a security practice that emphasise multilayer defences
composed of multiple countermeasures of varying complexity, application, and
rigour. It heavily relies on the application of segmentation (single point of
compromised wouldn't bring down the whole system).

A competent defence in depth strategy should be self-organising, highly
adaptable, reactively resilient, proactively innovative, and harmonious with
system purpose.
