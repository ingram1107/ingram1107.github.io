# Defence in Depth

Defence in depth is a security practice that emphasise multilayer defences
composed of multiple countermeasures of varying complexity, application, and
rigour. It heavily relies on the application of segmentation (no single point of
failure).

A competent defence in depth strategy should be self-organising, highly
adaptable, reactively resilient, proactively innovative, and harmonious with
system purpose.
