# Target Debug Agent

Target debug agent offers programmers a set of debug commands or capabilities
and often lets them set up execution and/or data access break points.
Programmers can utilise it to examine and modify system memory, registers, and
objects. They don't have to understand the remote's native debug agent commands
as the agent's command are mapped into host debugger commands in a more
descriptive way.
