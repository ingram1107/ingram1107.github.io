# Method of Direct Proof

Method of direct proof is an application of [Method of Generalising from the Generic Particular](202302281200.md)
on [Universal Conditional Statement](202207200932.md). The following steps guide
one to prove a statement with direct proof method:

1. Express the statement to be proved in the form "$\forall x \in D$, if $P(x)$
   then $Q(x)$".
2. Start the proof by supposing $x$ is a *particular* (single quantity) but
   *arbitrarily chosen* (generic) element of $D$ for which the hypothesis $P(x)$
   is true. ("Where am I starting from?" or "What am I supposing?")
3. Show that the conclusion $Q(x)$ is true by using **definitions**,
   previously established **results** or **theorem**, and the rules for
   [logical inference](202205061240.md). ("What conclusion do I need to show in
   order to complete the proof?")
