# Direct Cache Access (DCA)

Although [Direct Memory Access (DMA)](202403151658.md) can improve performance
of I/O operations, it can also cause [cache](202403191017.md) misses as CPU
can't know the arrival of packets from peripherals ahead of time in order to
[prefetch](202407271944.md). To solve this, Intel has incorporated DCA
technology into their chipsets and processors to populate CPU cache which will
be notified about the incoming packet with its data. Packet headers are read to
determine their urgency and for decision-making on handling packets. Both DMA
and DCA can be done simultaneously unlike traditional approach, thus improve the
I/O operation performance.

DCA requires integration of I/O #hardware, chipset, and CPU for it to work.
