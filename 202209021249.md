# Single-Mode Fibre-Optic Cable

Single-Mode #[Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md) composed of four layers, from
outer layer to inner layer: the jacket (900 µm), buffer (250 µm), cladding (125
µm), and core (8-9 µm). Due to its small core diameter (compare to
[Multimode Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021240.md)), it allows only one mode light
propagation. However, in compensation, the light pulse could travel in
long distance, and it can carry high bandwidth without worrying too much about
distortion.
