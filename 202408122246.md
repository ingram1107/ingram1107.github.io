# Wireless Technologies Security Concerns

[Wireless technologies](202303301607.md) has several extra security concerns
comparing to its wired counterpart. This includes high
[Latency](202304111955.md), unstable connection, the use of common
[medium](202302161842.md) (easier to tap), larger attack vector from user space
([Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md)). Other technologies also contribute to
security risks, such as [HLR](202303312031.md)/[VLR](202303312030.md) (may
expose user's location), [Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)](202303021618.md),
[Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)](202408122255.md), and [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](202209012218.md)
(vulnerable to [Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM)](202210061036.md)).

We can discuss wireless security at different levels such as
[application-level](202408141418.md), [middleware-level](202408141420.md),
[TCP/IP-level](202408141425.md), or [wireless link-level](202408141426.md).
