Sensor can be [active](202404061103.md) or [passive](202404061104.md). Its
performance is determined by the range of the value of measured stimulus, the
resolution of the stimulus, sensing frequency, accuracy, size, operational
temperature and environment conditions, service life or number of operation
cycle, and cost.
