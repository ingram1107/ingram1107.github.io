# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC is a process to set up a development or production environment
(infrastructure) which includes servers, databases, applications etc.
declaratively by using languages such as YAML and [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)](202206061645.md).
We can imagine it as the tool could use the *blueprint* to automatically
construct a house without manual labour to do so.

It makes the underlying infrastructure scalable especially for
[cloud environment](202210012158.md)# environment. Since the set-up is coded
into a file, [Version Control System (VCS)](202208131616.md)# could be used on
it, where human errors can be traced and reverted easily to reduce
inconsistency.

IaC tools could be categorised according to their functions and their role
during the set-up:
- [Infrastructure Configuration Management](202205041217.md)#
- [Server Templating](202206061434.md)#
- [Infrastructure Provisioning](202206061439.md)#
