# On Improving a Sorting Algorithm

Every array of numbers, if unsorted, will have *inversion*, which is an ordered
pair $(i, j)$ where $i < j$ but $A[i] > A[j]$. The average number of inversions
in an array of size $N$ is $\frac{N(N - 1)}{4}$ which is also $\Omega(N^2)$.

For algorithms that only perform adjacent swaps, such as [202202220937](202202220937.md),
[202202232135](202202232135.md) and [202202232215](202202232215.md), will only able to run $\Omega(N^2)$ on
average time since exactly one inversion will be resolved after each comparison.

To solve this, one need to eliminate **more than one inversion** in order to
achieve at least $o(N^2)$ running time.
