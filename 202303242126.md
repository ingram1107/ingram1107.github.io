# User Experience (UX)

UX describes how a product behaves and is used by the people in the real world.
It is about the feeling or sentimental of the user while using or interact with
the product, thus is highly depended on the context (where the
[interaction](202303242118.md) is taking place). Therefore, such abstract
concept can't be designed and hard to be measured. Instead, we should design for
UX. Despite its abstract nature, it is important in interaction design (ID) to
identify the important aspects so that the product can be more fun and
enjoyable, enable designers to be aware of different results from different
[design combination](202304152141.md), and put importance on user's sentimental
feeling (pleasure and satisfaction) on the product.
