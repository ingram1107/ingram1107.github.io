# User Experience (UX)

UX describes how a product behaves and is used by the people in the real world.
It is about the feeling or sentimental of the user while using or interact with
the product, thus is highly depended on the context (where the interaction is
taking place). Therefore, such abstract concept can't be designed and hard to be
measured. Instead, we should design for UX.
