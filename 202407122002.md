# CPU Non-Temporal Access (NTA)

Intel's SSE4.1 extensions introduces NTA loads for optimisation on reading of
uncacheable memory like [Memory-Mapped I/O](202404061058.md). It is implemented
using some streaming load buffers where each of them contains a cache line.
Cache lines are loaded into the buffers and be accessed there. By limiting
loading those cache lines into a [CPU Cache](202403191017.md), it enables the
loading of large amounts of memory without cache pollution.
`_mm_stream_load_si128()` [intrinsics](202404151959.md) provides NTA function
for programmers. Since there are plenty of streaming load buffers available, it
is possible to read from two memory location at once.
