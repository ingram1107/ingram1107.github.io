# Genomics

Genomics is a study of [Genomes](202308152055.md) including large chromosomal
segments containing many coding and non-coding DNA. It aims to map and sequence
an initial set of entire genomes. Functional genomics aims to deduce information
of the function of DNA sequences. Comparative genomics instead aims to compare
genome structure and functions across different species or strains.

The analysis of genomics involves high [Throughput](202304111957.md) DNA
sequence and [Bioinformatics](202308152050.md) to assemble and analyse the
function and structure of the entire genomes.
