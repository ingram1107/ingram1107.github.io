# Wireless Session Protocol (WSP)

WSP is a [Session Layer](202206131849.md) interface for connection-oriented and
connectionless services. It consists of HTTP/1.1 browsing applications and
allows a [WAP](202302161711.md) proxy to connect a WSP client to a standard
[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md) server. It is optimised
for low-bandwidth [bearer networks](202303292214.md) with long latency.
