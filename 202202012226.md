# Kubernetes Controller Manager

Controller Manager is a process running on [Kubernetes](202201291535.md)'s
#[Kubernetes Master Node](202202012056.md) that notifies [Kubernetes Scheduler](202202012216.md)
when there is a change of [cluster](202304251207.md) status. This is
particularly useful in rescheduling dead pods.
