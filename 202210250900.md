# Administrative Distance (AD)

AD is a numeric value that specifies the preference of a particular
[route source](202207061815.md)# which range from 0 to 255. The lower the value,
the more trust the [Router](202207061800.md) will be on the source. The
following table shows the AD value for each route source.

| Router Source                                                          | Default AD |

In #[Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md), it could be
shown using the command `show ip route` and inspect the routing table. It is
typically in the format of:

```
D    192.168.6.0/24 [120/1] via ...
```

There first value in the square bracket shows the AD for the route, which is
RIP. The second value in the bracket indicates the metric of the route.

A much robust way to show the AD value for each protocol is to run the command
`show ip protocols`.
