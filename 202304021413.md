# Server-Side Scripting

Server-side scripting is a design decision where the scripts are run on the
server side to generate custom responses for clients such as dynamic web page,
query response, [Database](202302101139.md) access, logging in etc. In short, it
extends the server functionality.

Examples of #software that implements server-side scripting are Microsoft web
servers (ISAPI extensions) and Apache HTTP servers (modules).
