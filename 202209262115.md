# Denial of Service (DoS)

DoS is a common threat to the [Internet Security](202209262108.md)# as the web
grow larger and larger. DoS and its evolved descendants, Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS), with sophistication of utilising wireless station to act like
[Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md), can seriously undermine the network
utilities by requesting excessive requests to the attack target (usually a
server) and making it running out of resources to process those requests.

Iterative servers are susceptible to DoS attacks as it requires the client to
open new [Named Pipe (FIFO)](202211080915.md). This could be solved by adding a
timeout or simply redesign them into [concurrent server](202202011815.md).
Modern [Firewall](202301211140.md) also have built-in support in resisting DoS.

Examples of DoS or DDoS are:
- [MAC Flooding](202303082023.md)
- [SYN Flooding](202304261356.md)
- UDP Flooding
- HTTP GET or POST Flooding
