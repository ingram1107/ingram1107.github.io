# Denial of Service (DoS)

DoS is a common threat to the [Internet Security](202209262108.md)# as the web
grow larger and larger. DoS and its evolved descendants, Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS), can seriously undermine the network utilities by requesting
excessive requests to the attack target (usually a server) and making it running
out of resources to process those requests.

Examples of DoS or DDoS are:
- [MAC Flooding](202303082023.md)
- [SYN Flooding](202304261356.md)
