# Port Address Translation (PAT)

PAT is a kind of #[202206281824](202206281824.md) that uses one public address for many private addresses (call overloading). Such sharing is possible because instead of assigning a public address to a private address, it utilises *high port numbers* (49152-65535) to establish a network connection session. This has an advantage of having more address space than other DNAT implementations.
