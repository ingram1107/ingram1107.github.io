# Port Address Translation (PAT)

PAT is a kind of #[Dynamic NAT](202206281824.md) that uses one public address
for many private addresses (call overloading). Such sharing is possible because
instead of assigning a public address to a private address, it utilises *high
port numbers* (49152-65535) to establish a network connection session. This has
an advantage of having more address space than other DNAT implementations.

Configuring an [edge router](202207061800.md) to have PAT is similar to
[Dynamic NAT](202206281824.md). If only single address should be used instead,
we need to define the [ACL](202302190738.md) with the command `access-list
{number} permit {source-ip} {wildcard}`, then establish dynamic source
translation with the command `ip nat inside source list {acl-number} interface
type {name} overload`. We can configure port forwarding by running the command
`ip nat inside source static {tcp | udp } {local-ip} {local-port} {global-ip}
{global-port}`. Like in [Static NAT](202206281819.md), we need to distinguish
between inside interface and outside interface of the edge router.
