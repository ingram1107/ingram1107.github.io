# Throughput

Throughput is a [measure](202304111951.md) on deliverable network resource
capacity, that is the amount of data that can be transferred per unit time.
Notice that it doesn't include [delay](202304111955.md) in the measurement. Be
aware that the difference between throughput and bandwidth. The latter could
describe the frequency used or the theoretical maximum amount of data that can
be delivered.
