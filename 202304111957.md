# Throughput

Throughput is a [measure](202304111951.md) on deliverable [network resource capacity](202304191208.md),
that is the amount of data that can be transferred per unit time. Notice that it
doesn't include [delay](202304111955.md) in the measurement. There are several
ways to measure the throughput: capacity of a single channel, aggregate or total
capacity of all channels, theoretical capacity of the underlying #hardware, or
[goodput](202304191204.md).

Be aware that the difference between throughput and bandwidth. The latter could
describe the frequency used or the theoretical maximum amount of data that can
be delivered.
