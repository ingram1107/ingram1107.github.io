# Throughput

Throughput is a [measure](202304111951.md) on deliverable [network resource capacity](202304191208.md),
that is the amount of data that can be transferred per unit time. Notice that it
doesn't include [delay](202304111955.md) in the measurement. There are several
ways to measure the throughput: capacity of a single channel, aggregate or total
capacity of all channels, theoretical capacity of the underlying #hardware, or
[goodput](202304191204.md).

The most common assessment on the throughput is by letting a sender sends a
*large volume* of data where a receiver will record the time from the start of
the first data arrived until the arrival of all data. Then, the receiver
calculates the throughput from the amount of data sent per unit of time,
typically in bits per second (bps).

Be aware that the difference between throughput and bandwidth. The latter could
describe the frequency used or the theoretical maximum amount of data that can
be delivered.
