# Mix Application

Mix application is a combination of [Vertical Application](202304161347.md) and
[Horizontal Application](202304161344.md), usually in the form of a customised
#software package. However, it comes with increase cost comparing to the
standard package, takes longer time to develop, and might not guarantee an
upgrade from the vendor. There are three methods to customise an application:
1. Purchase a basic package that the vendors will customise to suit the business
  needs.
2. Negotiate directly with the vendor, tweaking the software to meet business
  needs by paying for the changes in the form of add-on package.
3. Purchase and modify (depending on the licence) the package.

The third approach is said to be the most expensive due to the unfamiliarity of
the software from the system analysts and programmers. Furthermore, such
software have to keep up with the standard package in order to patch critical
security issues or obtain new features from the upstream provider.
