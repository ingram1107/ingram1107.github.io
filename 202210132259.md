# Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer is a networking simulation tool developed by Cisco. It
allows user to build up virtual topologies and emulate designed computer
networks. This includes the emulation of [Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md)#.

When dealing with router, especially installing modules such as serial interface
(HWIC-2T) on it, switch off the router first. If the module installation has
been completed, then the router is safe to turn on.

In a lab environment, it is recommended to disable [Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md)
lookup with the command `no ip domain-lookup` on the router. It is to speed up
the configuration process as the router will try to search anything that it
don't know on a [TFTP](202303021112.md) server. Often, the server doesn't exist,
and without the command, the router will waste times on figuring out things that
it doesn't understand, typically a wrong typed command.
