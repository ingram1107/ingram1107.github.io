# Rule-based Detection

Rule-based Detection defines a set of rules which will be used to determine if
given behaviour is coming from an [Intruder](202301021642.md). Two approaches
could be implemented: **anomaly detection** (detect deviation from previous
usage patterns) and **penetration identification** (search for suspicious
behaviour using [Expert System](202211082218.md)#).
