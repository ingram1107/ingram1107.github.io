# Mach

Mach is a microkernel-based operating system. All of [[202203021652|its
UNIX-specific code]]# are moved to the user-mode servers, only leaves few
necessary abstractions or features inside the kernel. This resulted that many
operating systems could run on top of Mach like [202204071131](202204071131.md)# without much
hassle.

Mach obliges the [Object-Oriented Programming principle (OOP)](202202041514.md)
where it treats all components in it as an object.

## Components

- **Task**: an execution environment that provides the basic unit of resource
  allocation. It consists of a *virtual address space* and protected access to
  system resources via *ports*, and it may contain one or more *threads*.
- **[Thread](202112061056.md)**: the basic unit of execution and must be run in
  the context of *task* where it inherits the task's *address space*, *ports*,
  *memory* etc. The resources are *shared* among the [threads](202112061109.md).
  Threads could use [202204222158](202204222158.md)# for communication.
- **Memory Object**: a source of memory which could be mapped into any tasks'
  address spaces.
- [202204222158](202204222158.md)# includes some other components such as **Port**, **Port
  Set** and **Messages**

## Networking

See [202203021733](202203021733.md)#

## CPU Scheduler

Mach maintains two thread queues: local and global queue. The threads in the
local queue have higher priority than those in the global queue. These queues
locked when there are incoming threads.

Mach itself maintain a list of idle processors.

It uses a flexible time quantum which will be adjusted accords to the current
total number of threads in the system.

## Memory management

[202206031311](202206031311.md)#

## Error handling

There are error handlers, one for each thread, in Mach. The thread and its error
handler will communicate [using message passing](202203021733.md)#, and the
handler will decide whether to resume or terminate the thread.
