# Perl Variable

Perl Variable could be defined in two scope: **lexical** and **package**.
Lexical variables are like local variables in other languages, that is its
lifetime end or get garbage collected when it is out of scope unless it is
[referenced](202207211229.md)#. They are defined by `my` keyword. Package
variables are defined in the most recently declared namespace's scope with the
`our` keyword. It is sort of like a global variable that will live throughout
the lifetime of the program. The following shows how to define a package
variable:

```perl
package MyPackage;
our $variable = "This is my variable";
```

If the package variable is defined in a lexical scope, and we want access it
outside the scope, we need to include the package qualifier in front of it shown
as follow:

```perl
print $MyPackage::variable;
```

To avoid hassles on changing package variable causes change in the program
state, `local()` function should be used in order to create a temporary variable
for the package variable. The change happened on the temporary variable will not
be propagated to the package variable in the global scope, thus it is safe for
alteration.

```perl
local($MyPackage::variable) = "Now it's temporary variable";
```
