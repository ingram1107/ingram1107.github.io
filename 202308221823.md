# Neighbour Joining (NJ)

NJ is a [distance method](202308152048.md) that keeps track of nodes on a tree
instead of taxa or clusters of taxa. It exhibits a star like structure which is
**unrooted**. It is suited for large datasets with different rates of evolution.

Initially, the raw data are provided as a distance matrix and the initial tree
is a star tree. NJ construct a new distance matrix by computing the net
divergence $r$, from the total distance of taxa $i$ from all other taxa, i.e.,
$d(i, 1) + d(i, 2) + \ldots d(i, n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes other than
the taxa $i$, with the following formula:

$$
M(ij) = d(i,j) - \frac{r(i) + r(j)}{n - 2}, \text{ where } i \le n, j \le n
$$

In the new matrix, NJ constructs a tree by linking the least-distant pair of
nodes or a pair of nodes that have the smallest value. We could calculate the
branch length with the following formula:

$$
\begin{align}
S(i, u) &= \frac{d(i,j)}{2} + \frac{r(i) - r(j)}{2(n-2)}\\
S(j, u) &= d(i,j) - S(i,u)
\end{align}
$$

This process is proceeded recursively until there is only two nodes left. As we
can see, it is a bottom up approach to [Clustering](202308212101.md).
Statistical data analysis could be applied using the bootstrap method.

**Note**: When there is negative branch length, set the said branch length to
zero and transfer the difference to the adjacent branch length. This is due to
the **additive** nature of the distance calculated from the algorithm.

NJ is a fast method and more reliable than [UPGMA](202308220845.md) that allows
lineages with largely different branch lengths and correction for multiple
substitutions. However, it suffers from the loss of sequence information, and it
is strongly dependent on the model of evolution used. Moreover, it gives only
one possible tree.
