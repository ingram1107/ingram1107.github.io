# Observer Pattern

Observer Pattern is a #[Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that could be used to
implement #[Views](202207041054.md) utilising the [Publish/Subscribe Protocol](202207041109.md).
It is rather useful at [decoupling](202202041514.md)# the presentations of the
data from the data itself. There are two objects in this pattern: **subject**
and **observer**. Observers don't need to know each other's existence, but
depends on the subject. When there is a change happen in subject, the subscribed
observers need to be notified to synchronise the change. This either done in
subject to notify all observers that it keep track of (broadcast), or making it
the observer's responsibility to trigger the update when it is needed
(centralised or peer-to-peer).

**Note**: Subject state should be self-consistent before notification to avoid
accessing subject in an inconsistent state. Always making sure that state
changing operation is done before the notification.

The Gang of Four advises to use this pattern when:
1. An abstraction has two aspects where one depends on the other.
2. A change to one object changes the other.
3. An object should be able to notify other objects without guessing who they
   are.

In case 1, we could encapsulate the aspects into two separate objects and apply
Observer Pattern. Case 2 wise we can just apply Observer Pattern directly, same
with Case 3.

If the updates become too complicated to handle, especially when observer is
subscribing to multiple subjects, a change manager class is needed to manage the
hassle so in the case when multiple subjects changes, the observer will be
notified only once. Such class should be in [Mediator Pattern](202211241530.md)#
and [Singleton Pattern](202211231900.md)#. It can be with simple approach or
[directed-acyclic graphs (DAG)](202204112118.md) approach. Simple change manager
will update all the registered observers of each subject. DAG change manager
instead handles the DAG of dependencies between subjects and their observers
which is usually preferable if an observer subscribes to multiple subjects as it
will update once to observer upon a change of multiple subjects.

**Note**: Only one change manager is needed for the entire program.
