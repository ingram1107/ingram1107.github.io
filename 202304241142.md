# Range

Range can simplify or abstract some operations for more readability especially
when combining with the pipe operation (`|`, like in #shell) supported in
[C++](202302190651.md) and #rust. Pipe operation will not introduce runtime
overhead, so there is no need to concern its effect on #performance. However, so
far in 2023, C++ doesn't support opt-in third party range adaptors to use the
pipe operation.[^revzin2021]

In C++, there are several interesting range's functions and [higher-order function](202304241202.md)
that could be used to achieve [Functional Programming](202203061121.md) style.
They are `filter()` (accepts a lambda to filter out elements in the range),
`take()` (takes out number of elements from the range), `drop_while()`,
`reverse` (reverse the order of elements in range), `drop_last_while()`
(proposed in C++23), and `rotate()` (perform left shifting).
