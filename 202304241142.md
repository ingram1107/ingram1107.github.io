# C++ Range

Range is an object that implements the `begin()` method which returns an
[Iterator](202202241727.md) that could be incremented until it is equal to
`end()` in which it may return a sentinel to mark the end of a range. It can
simplify or abstract some operations for more readability especially when
combining with the pipe operation (`|`, like in #shell) supported in
[C++](202302190651.md) and #rust. Pipe operation will not introduce runtime
overhead while provides a visual linear sequence of execution, so there is no
need to concern its effect on #performance. However, so far in 2023, C++ doesn't
support opt-in third party range adaptors to use the pipe
operation.[^revzin2021]

**Note**: There is a special sentinel `std::ranges::unreachable_sentinel` in
which the comparison done on it with any other iterators will always return
false.

There are several interesting range's functions and [higher-order function](202304241202.md)
that could be used to achieve [Functional Programming](202203061121.md) style.
They are `filter()` (accepts a lambda to filter out elements in the range),
`take()` (takes out number of elements from the range), `drop_while()`,
`reverse` (reverse the order of elements in range), `drop_last_while()`
(proposed in C++23), and `rotate()` (perform left shifting) which most are from
`std::ranges::views` namespace. Interestingly, most functions in the
`std::ranges` namespaces accept a [C++ Container](202202241719.md) parameter
with optional parameters of projection (a unary callable which may be passed to
most algorithms and modify the data view that the algorithm see) and
`std::invoke`. Few examples of projection are `std::ranges::less{}`,
`std::ranges::equal_to{}`, and `{}` for default projection used for the
algorithm. The use of the `std::invoke` further eliminate the use of lambda in
the codebase as we'll show below. We illustrate the use of the
`std::ranges::sort()` to show the use of container, projection, and
`std::invoke` with the following codes:

```cpp
std::vector<Element> Elements {3, 1, 2};
std::ranges::sort(Elements);  // sort vector with the default projection

// sort vector with the projection or comparison ::eqaul_to where the
// std::invoke return the reference of Element.value
std::ranges::sort(Elements, std::ranges::equal_to{}, &Element.value);
```
