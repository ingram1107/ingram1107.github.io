# Android Application Components

When designing an android application, we can utilise several software
components offered by Android OS libraries' constructors in order to form a
coherent view on the application and capable of providing services to users.
This includes **Activity** (basic component that provides a user interface for
one specific task), **Service** (background processing), **Broadcast Receiver**
(mailbox for processes that provides [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md)),
**Intent**, **Content Provider** (data storage facility backed by SQL which
supports data exchange between applications) etc.
