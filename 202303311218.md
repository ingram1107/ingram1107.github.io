# First-Generation Cellular Network (1G)

Invented in the early 1980s, 1G provides mobile voice service by analogue
transmission. [Geographical area](202303292152.md) is divided into small cells,
each cover up to 10 to 25 km, where frequency reuse can be exploited in nearby
cells. Due to its analogue nature, 1G is susceptible to malicious
[Masquerade](202209262114.md) and [Interception](202209261916.md) via
[all band radio receiver](202305162150.md). It applies the
[Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA)](202303301632.md).

Examples of 1G:
- Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS)
- European Total Access Communication System (E-TACS)
