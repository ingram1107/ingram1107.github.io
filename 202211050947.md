# Generator Matrix

Generator Matrix is a canonical form in which its row $k$ are linearly
independent. In other words, it is not possible to express any row of the matrix
as a linear combination of the remaining rows. It is defined as below:

$$
G = [P|I_k]
$$

Where:
- $P$ is the $k$ by $n-k$ coefficient matrix defined in #[Linear Block Coding](202211041839.md)
- $I_k$ is the [Identity Matrix](202211041921.md)#

To get the codewords from the equation, we need to first calculate out the total
amount of possible messages using $b^k$ where $b$ is the base used for encoding.
Then, fill out all the codewords based on $I_k$ that aligned to the messages
pattern, and we will get the codeword in the form $P_i I_i$ where $i$ is the row
in $G$. To find out others, we utilise the bit-wise XOR on $P$ to get the desire
message $m_i$ based on $I_i$, where the result is still in the form of $P_i
I_i$. Note that $m_i$ and $I_i$ should have same bit pattern. From here, we
can calculate the [Hamming Weight](202211122222.md)#.

**Note**: Message with all zeros always encoded as all zeros as well in the
codewords.

In [Cyclic Code](202212192231.md) world, a Generator Matrix can be constructed
using the following formula from #[Generator Polynomial](202212192305.md):

$$
G = g(D), Dg(D), \ldots, D^{k-1} g(D)
$$

Where:
- each of them represents a row, from first to $k-1$
