# China Blue Sea Challenges

To gain access to Pacific Ocean, there are mainly three choke points, i.e.,
Taiwan Strait (the narrowest width is 100.9 miles or 162.38 km), Bashi Channel
(87.7 miles or 140.66 km), and Yonaguni Channel (与那国島, 66.7 miles or 107.34
km). In order to bypass the First Island Chain (第一島鏈), China must first gain
firm military and political control over Taiwan. Yonaguni Channel is impractical
to carry out such operation as Japanese government had set up cruise missiles in
the region since 2023. To have a successful landing on the island with enough
logistical support, China instead locks her eyes on the largest port in Taiwan,
the Kaohsiung port (高雄), which is responsible for 62% of cargo volume
containing energy, machine, and food supplies for Taiwanese daily needs. Since
the landing operation on Taiwan is a geopolitical decision with great
consequences on international community, China has to decisively deny any
possible reinforcement to the island especially from the other side of the
Pacific Ocean, the United States (US). Therefore, Bashi Channel becomes a
crucial point on deciding the success of the invasion and future power
projection to cut off US supplies to Taiwan from the Philippines and control the
bottlenecks of the global sea trade and underwater cable that connects South
East Asia (SEA), South Asia, North America, and Japan (97% to 99% of global net
traffic). [^kamome-ph-2023]

**Note**: US can supply Taiwan via military base located at Okinawa (沖縄).

To secure the region, US counters China's strategy by increasing the capacity of
military bases in the Philippines to deny Chinese strategic space in the South
China Sea and threaten South China. [^kamome-ph-2023]

Accessing India Ocean is another geopolitical problem for China as India
controls the north-west entrance into the Malacca Strait through its possession
of Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands. The only possible breakthrough is via
the Myanmar's Preparis Channel, a sea channel separated by two parts: 30 miles
or 48.28 km between Coco Islands and Preparis Island, and 83 miles or 133.58 km
between the island and Myanmar mainland. Therefore, even though there was a plan
to develop Kra Canal at the south of Thailand, it serves only a partial solution
to bypass the blockade from Indian and US navies. [^kamome-in-2023]
