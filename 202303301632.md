# Frequency-Division Multiple Access (FDMA)

Users of FDMA share the [radio spectrum](202302161842.md) in which FDMA assigns
different frequency channels (divided from the spectrum) to different users
permanently or temporarily. Note that different channel is assigned for each
direction of transmission. This means that the user can access the channel
continuously, but has only fixed partial portion of the full bandwidth.
Therefore, it has a relatively poor channel efficiency especially during quiet
time. Since there is a need to receive and transmit signals simultaneously,
[Diplexer](202303311210.md) is needed in FDMA case. Multiple carriers are
needed. Unlike [Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA)](202303301637.md), FDMA
base station must have a dedicated channel unit for each session. FDMA is mostly
replaced by other newer [Medium Access Control (MAC) Technologies](202303301623.md).
