# Systematic Code

Systematic Code is a #[Block Code](202210290914.md) in which message bits are
transmitted in unaltered form. The use of Systematic Code simplifies the
implementation of #[decoder](202209291041.md).

For example, if the resulting [Generator Matrix](202211050947.md) or
[Parity-Check Matrix](202212201918.md) is not systematic, we could XOR the
non-systematic part out with rows that exhibits systematic characteristic.

$$
G' = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc}
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1
\end{array} \right]
$$

Row 3 and 4 is not systematic as it doesn't fulfil the property of being a
[Generator Matrix](202211050947.md) where $G = [P|I^k]$ as there are
discrepancies in [Identity Matrix](202211041921.md). Here, we XOR Row 3 with Row
1 in order to neutralise the 5th bit (which is 1) in order to make it
systematic. Following the steps, we could get the final result systematic $G$:

$$
G = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccccc}
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array} \right]
$$
