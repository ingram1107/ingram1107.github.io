# GPRS Session Management

Before transmission or receiving information in [General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)](202304111940.md),
the [Mobile Station](202305162139.md) has to activate a Packet Data Protocol
(PDP) context. It initiates the PDP context request to [Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)](202404111203.md)
which includes information like [IP Address](202206281021.md), [Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md),
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md), and Network Service Access Point
Identifier (NSAPI). SGSN then initiates the creation of PDP context with the
passing of parameters including IP address, AP, QoS, and tunnelling ID (TID)
from [Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)](202404111209.md). From now on, a PDP
context is activated with IP address, QoS, and TID, and returned to SGSN. SGSN
will grant the mobile station the PDP context includes information such as IP
address, priority level, QoS, TID, NSAPI, and GGSN address.
