# The Reign of Caliph Umar bin Al-Khattab

Umar bin Al-Khattab is the second [Caliph](202302181011.md) who was hand-picked
by [Abu Bakar](202302181017.md) as the successor before his death in 634. He
reformed the political system of the Caliphate by establishing Consultative
Supreme Council and Consultative Public Council. The first members for the
supreme council included the most important figures such as [Uthman bin Affan](202302241122.md),
[Ali bin Abi Talib](202302241134.md), Zaid bin Tsabit, Abdul, Rahman bin Auf,
Saad bin Abi Waqas, and Mu'az bin Jabal. The councils are responsible for
hosting discussion on politics, security and social issues in the Caliphate and
policy decision on administration and diplomacy. Furthermore, Umar rewards the
newly conquered region to the general who seized them. However, he remained
sceptical on Khalid Al-Walid and refused to reward him due Umar's argument that
Khalid was lack of morality. During his reign, the Caliphate seized Mesopotamia,
Egypt, Palestine, Syria, North Africa and Armenia by attacking Byzantine (East
Roman) Empire and crushing Sassanid Persia. He was later assassinated by a
Persian slave in 644.
