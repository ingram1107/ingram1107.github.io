# Background Processing

Background processing is a processing policy where [Processes](202210062301.md)
are run in the lowest priority which can be [pre-empted](202404141550.md) by any
[foreground processes](202404150708.md). Background processes are non-interrupt
driven, which can be appeared in [polled loop](202404131853.md),
[State-Driven](202404141411.md), or [Co-Routines](202404141417.md) fashion.

With the combination of [Foreground Processing](202404150708.md), the system can
provide good response times as they rely on [Hardware Scheduling](202404141538.md).
But, the interfaces to complicated devices and networks must be written which
are tedious and error prone. It is susceptible to timing variations,
[Race Condition](202112061109.md), and hardware failures. It is advised to
employ this kind of system when the number of foreground processes are fixed and
known in a priori.
