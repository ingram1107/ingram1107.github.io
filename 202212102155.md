# Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA) on El Gamal

We could perform a #[CCA](202209281257.md) on [El Gamal Encryption](202212102116.md)#
with the following steps assuming that we have the ciphertext $C = (c_1, c_2)$:
1. Generate a random number $r$
2. Compute $c_2' = rc_2 \mod p$, which will be used as part of the chosen
   ciphertext
3. Submit the chosen ciphertext $(c_1, c_2')$ where we will receive $M' = rM
   \mod p$ (proof shown below)
4. Deduce $M$ with the formula $M = M'r^{-1} = Mrr^{-1} \mod p$

Prove $M' = rM \mod p$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
M' &= \frac{c_2'}{c_1^x}\\
&= \frac{rc_2}{c_1^x}\\
&= \frac{rMy^k}{g^{kx}}\\
&= \frac{rMy^k}{y^{k}}\\
&= rM \mod p
\end{aligned}
$$

**Note**: We know that $c_2 = My^k \mod p$ and $c_1 = g^k \mod p$ from El
Gamal's encryption algorithm and $y = g^x \mod p$ from key generation part.
