# Cloud Infrastructure

[Cloud](202210012158.md) infrastructure has several mechanisms in order to build
up a functional cloud environments for the clients. These mechanisms include
**logical network parameter**, **virtual server**, **cloud storage device**,
**cloud usage monitor**, **resource replication**, and **ready-made
environment**.

Logical network parameter (LNP) provides the isolation of a network environment
from the rest of a communications network. A virtual network boundary is
established which can encompass and isolate a group of cloud-based IT resources
that may be physically distributed across different geographical location. It is
usually achieved by *virtual firewall* and *virtual network* ([Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)).

Virtual server is a [Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md) that runs
virtualisation software on it. The server instances are typically created in
cloud storage device.

A cloud storage device represents storage devices that are design specifically
for cloud-based provisioning. [Virtualisation](202311161439.md) technology is
generally used for storage devices in order to have a unified view on the
storage. As such, the cloud provider is able to provide fixed-increment capacity
allocation in support of the pay-per-use mechanism. Data can be grouped into
*files*, *blocks*, *datasets/records*, or *objects*. The cloud provider could
use *network storage interfaces*, *object storage interfaces*, or *database
storage interfaces* for the data access. Network storage interface makes the
storage devices in compliance with the industry standard protocols like
[SCSI](202202041945.md) for storage blocks, Server Message Block (SMB) or Samba
on Linux, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and [Network File System (NFS)](202302131659.md).
Object storage interface, like SNIA's CDMI, treat data as objects, and is
accessible via REST API or web service-based cloud services using HTTP as the
prime protocol. Database storage interface supports query language and basic
storage operations via API or administrative user-interface.

Cloud usage monitor is responsible for collecting and processing IT resource
usage data. It can be implemented in different formats, such as *monitoring
agent* (intermediary, event-driven, resides along existing communication paths),
*resource agent* (event-driven interactions with specialised resource software),
and *polling agent* (polling IT resources via sampling the status of an external
device).

Ready-made environment mechanism is a defining component of the
[Platform as a Service (PaaS)](202310311815.md) cloud delivery model that
represents a pre-defined, cloud-based platform comprised of a set of already
installed IT resources, ready to be used and customised by a cloud consumer.

There are other specialised mechanisms to fulfil specific runtime-functions in
support of one or more cloud characteristics. This includes **automated scaling
listener**, **load balancer**, **SLA monitor**, **pay-per-use monitor**, **audit
monitor** (for regulatory and contractual obligations), **failover system**,
**[Hypervisor](202311161500.md)**, **resource cluster** (group multiple resource
instances into a single resource with the help of high-speed dedicated network
connections), **multi-device broker**, and **state management database**.

Automated scaling listener is a service agent that monitors and tracks
communications between cloud service consumers and cloud services for dynamic
scaling purposes. It is deployed within the cloud, near the firewall to track
the workload, including the volume of cloud consumer-generated requests and
back-end processing demands triggered by specific types of requests, status
information.

[Load balancer](202210242151.md) is a runtime agent responsible for balancing
workload across two or more IT resources. A set of performance and
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) rules is usually configured to
improve the IT resource usage. There are several specialised runtime workload
distribution functions to be performed such as *asymmetric distribution*
(high-processing capacities IT resources have larger workloads), *workload
prioritisation*, *content-aware distribution*. A load balancer may be
implemented as a [multilayer network switch](202207051907.md), dedicated
hardware appliance, dedicate software-based system, or service agent.

Pay-per-use monitor concerns variables such as *request/response message
quantity*, *transmitted data volume*, and *bandwidth consumption*.

Failover system allows the switch over to redundant IT resource instance in the
case of unavailability of the current active IT resource. The configuration may
be *active-active* (two instances serve synchronously with the help of load
balancing) or *active-passive* (one active instance with a standby).

Multi-device broker facilitates runtime data transformation so that wide ranges
of programs and devices can have access to the cloud service. It exists as a
gateway or incorporate gateway component such as [XML](202305281742.md) gateway,
cloud storage gateway, and mobile device gateway.

State management database is a storage device used to temporarily persist state
data for software programs, acts as an alternative to caching state data in
memory to reduce the data amount incurred by runtime memory.
