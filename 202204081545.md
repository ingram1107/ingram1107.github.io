# Locate a Bug

There are several ways methods to locate a bug:
- [202203061248](202203061248.md)#
- [202207091744](202207091744.md)# (useful on *preconditions*, *post conditions* and
  *invariants*)
- backtracking from where you think the problem occurred
- divide-and-conquer by halving the codes (binary search)
- use tracing statements (printing messages as simple as "got here" or "value of
  x is 2" to the screen or the following, suggested by
  [Hunt et al.](lit/@Hunt1999.md)) and/or logging facilities
- comment out code that is not involved in bug reproducing
- make problem worse
- scientific method (making hypothesis and verify it)
- Check the variable's surrounding memory area (if it is corrupted)

**Note**: Tracing statements and the log file should be in a regular, consistent format so one could read or parse them easily.

## Deterministic Problems

To locate a deterministic problem:

1. Review logs
2. Add assertions to verify invariants
3. Use iterative debuggers, using divide-and-conquer
4. Or, add assertions, using divide-and-conquer

## Non-Deterministic Problems

To locate a non-deterministic problem:

1. Review logs
2. Create a debug build
3. Add assertions to verify invariants
4. Add assertions, and/or commenting out code, using divide-and-conquer
5. Try to make the problem worse
6. Use low-overhead debugging tools
