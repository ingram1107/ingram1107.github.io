# Capability Maturity Model (CMM)

CMM reviews the processes, practices, and behaviours of an organisation. It
defines five maturity levels, from low to high: **initial** (most not
documented, little performance measures and planning, tend to be reactive),
**repeatable** (yield consistent results), **defined** (documented), **managed**
(measured to determined if the process is suitable), and **optimising**
(constantly evaluated for improvement).
