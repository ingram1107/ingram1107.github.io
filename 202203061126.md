# Clojure's Persistence Collections

Clojure uses persistence collections such as *list*, *vector* and *map* to
#[make copy efficient](202203061121.md).

*List* is constructed as a [singly linked list](202110191729.md). It allows
sequential access, but random access is forbidden. List could only point to
another list or to itself.

*Vector* is constructed as a [202112121746](202112121746.md). It allows sequential access as
well as random access by referring to its index number.

*Map* is constructed as a [202112122035](202112122035.md). It allows only random access by
referring to the key stored in it.
