# Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

WMI is the Microsoft implementation of [Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM)](202211211009.md)#
and [Common Information Model (CIM)](202211211012.md)#. It is particularly
useful for retrieving and managing the Windows operating system's information.

It can be accessed via PowerShell command `Get-CimInstance` or with open source
GUI tool WMI Explorer.
