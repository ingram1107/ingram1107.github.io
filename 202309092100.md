# Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson (GOR) method

GOR is similar to [Chou-Fasman Method](202309092050.md) based on a window of 17
residues, but additionally takes consideration of conditional probability of
[Amino Acid](202308082207.md) to form [Secondary Structure](202309092041.md)
given its immediate neighbours have already formed that structure. It can
achieve 65% accuracy, and is more successful in predicting $\alpha$ helix.

The frequency of each amino acid in residues is calculated from the connection
of the sample proteins yielding a 17 $\times$ 20 scoring matrix. Based on this
matrix, we can use it to calculate the probability that each residue in the
sequence will be involved in the helix, sheet, and turn.
