# TWT2231 Chapter 4: JavaScript Basic

In short, #javascript is a client-side interpreted #programming-language that
implements dynamic binding (checks object references at runtime). Most
importantly, it can access browser objects.

**Note**: Array `sort()` can take a function or lambda (arrow function) to
change the behaviour of the default behaviour of sorting the elements based on
the Unicode value.

**Note**: Pay attention to array's methods like `join()`, `indexOf()`, and
`lastIndexOf()`.

**Note**: Pop-up boxes are not customisable. If a custom pop-up box is needed,
we need to build it from scratch with [HTML elements](202304021219.md) and
[CSS](202304091409.md).
