# Self-Modifying Code (SMC)

SMC is usually implemented to reduce program size to make room for data or
payload. It should be avoided in practice other than in the field of performance
improvement or security exploit. SMC creates performance problem if it is not
done correctly as the code is not store in [L1i Cache](202403191017.md). This
may cause stall due to its dynamic nature.
