# Namespace Isolation

Namespace Isolation is a technique used by #[Docker](202110201636.md) in order
to isolate the running containers from the main operating system which at the
same time does not alter the mechanism used to allocate the resources for
processes.

For example, although as appeared the PID for the containers viewed from
[Docker CLI](202203281416.md) are always started from 1, if we viewed it from
the main operating system's perspective, the PID might be totally different. The
operating system treats that as a regular task just like other processes, but
since those tasks are in Docker's namespace, it cannot see others' resources and
will not be seen from them as well.
