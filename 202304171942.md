# Web-based System Development

Web-based system is developed and delivered in an Internet-based framework where
the Web is treated as the platform. It treats the [software as a service](202304161334.md)
which is less dependent on the desktop computing power and resources, and
minimise the [in-house involvement](202304161347.md). Thus, it has great
scalability compare to [traditional system](202304171938.md) and cross-platform.
That being said, if there are existing software and/or legacy systems, there is
a need of middleware to communicate with them. Web-base system is often used for
customer relationship management, order processing, and materials management.
