# C++ Traits

C++ standard libraries contains `type_traits` and `iterator_traits` defined in
the libraries `<type_traits>` and `<iterator>` respectively. They are used
heavily in [Compile Time Type Determination](202204181536.md)# and
[Template Deduction Guide](202204182011.md)# but soon deem unnecessary due to
the introduction of #[C++ Concepts](202203281200.md) in C++20.

You could get an #[Iterator](202202241727.md)'s category by using the following
alias:

```cpp
template<typename Iter>
using Iterator_category_v = typename std::iterator_traits<Iter>::iterator_category;
```

We could design and implement traits classes to store information inside
templates by following certain steps. First, we have to identify the types'
information and its appropriate identifiable name, then provide a template and a
set of specifications that contain the information for the types. We can use the
traits classes to create a set of overload worker functions or function
templates that differ in trait, in which we can create master function or
function template that calls workers, passing information provided by traits
classes.
