# Conditional Variable in Pthread
Conditional variable is used alongside with #[mutex](202112061117.md) to have fine
control of the threads' execution's sequence. This could improve the
synchronisation of all the threads as they could continue their execution only
when they have been signalled to do so.

In pthread, before using the conditional variable, initialise it by creating an
object of `pthread_cond_t` and call the function `pthread_cond_init` on it.
**Note the similar syntax** it shares with #[mutex](202112061117.md). In order to
order (pun intended) the thread to wait in line rather than just continue its
execution, we need to call `pthread_cond_wait` with a mutex that pass into it.
After that, to destroy a `pthread_cond_t` object, call `pthread_cond_destroy` at
the end of the program.

```c
pthread_cond_t cond;

// in the program
pthread_cond_init(&cond, NULL);

// in the threads that should wait
pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);

// at the end of the program
pthread_cond_destroy(&cond);
```

Depends on the situation, one would use either `pthread_cond_signal` or
`pthread_cond_broadcast` to unblock the execution. `pthread_cond_signal` only
unblock **one** thread at a time. In contrast, `pthread_cond_broadcast` send the
signal to wake up all the waiting threads.

```c
// only unblock one at a time
pthread_cond_signal(&cond);

// unblock all the waiting threads
pthread_cond_broadcast(&cond, &mutex);
```

## Static Initialiser
Just like #[mutex](202112061117.md), conditional variable could use static
initialiser to initialise itself in order to reduce the number of code.

```c
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
```

There is no need to call `pthread_cond_init` and `pthread_cond_destroy`.
However, it is always a good practice to keep `pthread_cond_destroy`.
