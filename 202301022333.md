# Unix Password Scheme

Unix passwords, after encrypted, are kept in a shadow directory (/etc/shadow)
that is only visible to root user. The legacy way of keeping the passwords in
/etc/passwd that is publicly readable is not secure any more.

These passwords will be converted into 56 bit value as a key, then encrypted
using `crypt` [Hash Function](202112122038.md)# which is based on
#[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md). In addition, a random 12-bit
salt value related to the time the password was created will be passed to the
cryptographic hash function. Such mechanism has the benefits of avoiding
duplicated ciphertext pattern for the same password created in different time,
increasing the password length, and preventing the use of #hardware DES
implementation. The encryption scheme is done in 25 iterations.
