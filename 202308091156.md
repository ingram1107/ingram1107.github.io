# Transcription

Transcription from [DNA](202308082154.md) to mRNA involves both strands from the
DNA in which one of the strand act as a template strand, and another as coding
strand. mRNA is then synthesised from the template strand of DNA which involves
enzyme RNA polymerase and transcription factors. Transcription is part of the
[Gene Expression](202308091143.md).
