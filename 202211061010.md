# Vernam Cipher

Vernam Cipher is a #[Substitution Cryptographic](202209281136.md) #algorithm
invented by Gilbert Vernam in 1918. It works on the binary data with bit-wise
XOR operation (or in [Modular Arithmetic](202210090858.md), $\mod 2$) and
chooses a key with no statistical relationship with the plaintext. It is widely
adopted as it could be implemented easily using hardware circuits. The
encryption scheme is formalised using the following equations:

$$
\begin{align}
C &= E_k(P) = P \oplus K\\
D &= D_k(C) = C \oplus K\\
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertext
- $P$ is the plaintext
- $K$ is the key
- $E$ is the encryption algorithm
- $D$ is the decryption algorithm
