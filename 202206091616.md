# Residual Edge

Residual Edge is an edge which flow to the opposite of the
[flow edge](202206091453.md)#. Similar to the flow edge, it has both **flow
value** and **maximum capacity** in the format of flow value/maximum capacity.
However, it is initialised to 0/0 unlike its counterpart.

The sole existence of Residual Edge is to *undo* or revert bad #[202206091601](202206091601.md)
which doesn't lead to #[maximum flow](202206091105.md). The Residual Edge is valid
to be included into the augmentation in the later iteration (the edge has been
*taken at least once*). When reverting, add the flow value of the residual edge
to the flow edge. It is to avoid having a
[negative remaining capacity](202206091453.md)# (the difference of the flow edge's
maximum capacity and flow value).
