# I/O Improvement in C++

There is some I/O overhead in C++ due to the necessity to sync C++ and C
streams for functions like `cout` and `printf` so they will have the same
behaviour and is thread-safe. Use `ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)` to improve
I/O performance in C++ but note that this could be just a **side effect**.
