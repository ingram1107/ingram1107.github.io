# Summary

The book is an ethnographic approach to the study on Terengganu palm oil
proletarians' transition. It is important as the state's systematic expansion to
the one third of the total land acreage used as palm oil plantation. The author
defines ethnography as a historically situated mode of understanding
historically situated contexts, each with its own perhaps radically different
kinds of subjects and subjectivities, objects and objectivities. Ethnography
should be sensitive to political economy, as self-conscious emphasis on the
strategic and purposeful situating of ethography should be linked to the broader
issue of the political economy.

The book agrees the argument of Sidney Mintz in viewing plantation represents
the earliest form of industrialisation, that is a capitalist system of
production, as plantation is a window to the world the colonialist and
capitalist made.

Utusan intelligentsia criticised the supposing "laziness" of Malay people,
especially those of from younger and more educated generation, doesn't work hard
enough in the plantation, which is in a sharp contrast to the Indonesian that
works even during important holiday like Ramadan and Adilfitri.

Historically, just before the domination of the [colonial powers](202203051018.md),
Terengganu aristocrats has already reorganised their economic resources in
anticipating such imminent situation. But those reorganisations inhibited the
rise of the bourgeoisie class as it only serves for their own status consumption
instead of siphoned back to the economy. The material condition for the rise of
the national bourgeoisie is further undermined by the colonial rules as the
political and economic rights of the aristocrats were dismantled by the colonial
government. The economic development of Terengganu was slow as it relied on
opium trade instead of the valuable trade goods like rubber and tin. The
situation was not improved even after independence as the federal government
reluctant to fund a state that was won by PAS.
