# DNA Replication

DNA replication is the process where a cell replicates its DNA prior to
division.

However, in the process of replication, there may be mutation or gene damage
that causes gene deviation. This could be either self-repaired by the gene
itself or become a risk for diseases. If the mutation happened at non-coding
regions instead, it has lower risk on affecting own health. The mutations coudl
be caused by replacements (or substitutions, one letter replaced by another),
deletion (deletino of a letter), and/or insertion (insertion of a letter).
