# DNA Replication

DNA replication is the process where a cell replicates its DNA prior to
division. However, in the process of replication, there may be mutation or gene
damage that causes gene deviation. This could be either self-repaired by the
gene itself or become a risk for diseases. If the mutation happened at
non-coding regions instead, it has lower risk on affecting own health.
