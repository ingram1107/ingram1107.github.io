# Write-Combining Cache Policy

Write-combining [Cache](202403191017.md) policy combines multiple write accesses
before the cache line is written. It aims to limit word transfer. This policy is
generally used for special address ranges, that is, Memory Type Range Registers
(MTRR). In this case, RAM of the graphic cards tend to use the write-combining
cache policy.
