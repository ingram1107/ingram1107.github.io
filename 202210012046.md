# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a process of **adding control information** as it passes down
through the layered model such as [Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md)#
and [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md)#. It is in direct
contrast to [Decapsulation](202210012048.md).
