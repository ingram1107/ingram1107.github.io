# Hand-off Management

Hand-off management is a process of consistent active connection of a mobile
unit while moving from one place to another. [^1] It usually takes around 30
milliseconds.

At any time when a [Mobile Station](202305162139.md) or device leaves a
[cell](202303292214.md) at the same time was under the control of a base
station, the latter will notice the mobile station's weak signal. It then asks
surrounding base stations if they are getting a stronger signal and transfers
the ownership on the mobile station to one with the strongest signal. After
that, [Mobile Telecommunications Switching Office (MTSO)](202305111959.md)
assigns new channel to the mobile station and notifies it of its new owner.
