# Unix System Call

System Call could be called in order to obtain services from Unix-based
operating system such as [Linux](202204081225.md) and #macos.

The POSIX library provides several C functions, shown as the following, for a
program to call system call:
- `fork` (create process by duplicating the calling [Process](202210062301.md)#)
- `exec` (execute a new [Program](202210062258.md)# and replace the current
  process)
  - `execlp` (the file will be searched in PATH environmental variable)
  - `execl`
  - `execle`
  - `execvp` (the file will be searched in PATH environmental variable)
  - `execv`
  - `execve`
- `wait` (suspends the parent process until the child finish its execution)
- `waitpid` (like `wait` but with specific process ID)
  - `WIFEXITED` returns non-zero if child terminated normally
  - `WEXITSTATUS` returns the exit status of the child process
  - `WNOHANGS` flags the process to not wait for the child
- `exit` (to terminate [Process](202210062301.md)#)
- `socket`
- `stat` (get file attributes)
- `fstat` (get file attributes)
- `system` (invoke commands)
- `open` (open file)
- `creat` (create file)
- `close` (close [File Descriptor](202210172248.md)#)
- `read` (read information from file)
- `write` (write information to file)
- `lseek` (moves the file pointer)
- `fcntl` (change the running file's properties)
- `kill` (send signal to process)
- `msgget` (create or access to [Message Queue](202212071258.md))
- `msgctl` (control operations on a message queue)
- `msgsnd` (write message to the message queue)
- `msgrcv` (read message from the message queue)
- `semget` (create or access to [Semaphore in System V](202212071928.md))
- `semctl` (control operations on a semaphore)
- `semop` (perform operations on semaphore)
