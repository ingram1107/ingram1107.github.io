# Cut-Through Switching

Cut-Through Switching, aka fast-forward switching, is a kind of #[switching mode](202207051907.md) that immediately forwards the frame received after the check on destination [202206151451](202206151451.md)#. Latency is not a problem, but in this mode, frames errors will be easily transmitted to other network segments.
