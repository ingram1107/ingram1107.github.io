# Traversal

To traverse a data structure for example #[tree](202112101956.md) or
#[graph](202204112045.md), one could use several methods:
- *pre-order*: traversal performed on a node **before** its children
- *post-order*: traversal performed on a node **after** its children
- *in-order*: traversal performed from the left to the node then to the right
- *level-order*: traversal performed on one depth to deeper depth

## Analysis

- This operation will result in $O(N)$

## Attention

- `NULL` case should be handled first
- In level-order traversal, do not use [recursive](202202151731.md) method, use it
  alongside with [Queue](202112101836.md) instead
