# Contradiction Rule

Contradiction Rule is a valid #[Argument](202205062050.md) which states that
if $p$ is false leads to a contradiction, then $p$ must be true. This is shown
as below:

$$
\begin{align}
&\sim p \rightarrow \textbf{c} \\
\therefore \ &p
\end{align}
$$

It can be proved by the following [Truth Table](202205061151.md)# :

| $p$ | $\sim p$ | $\textbf{c}$ | $\sim p \rightarrow \textbf{c}$ | $p$ |
| --- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | --- |
| T   | F        | F            | ==T==                           | T   |
| F   | T        | F            | F                               |     |
