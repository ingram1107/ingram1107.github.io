# Semantic

Semantic is the meaning of the expressions, statements, and program units. It
can be categorised into **operational semantic** and **denotational
semantic**. Operational semantic expresses the meaning in a local,
progress-oriented way that requires the programmer to think as a machine.
Denotational semantic, on the other hand, expresses the meaning in #declarative
way, usually involving translating the program into #math expressions, which is
usually implemented in [Functional Programming](202203061121.md).
