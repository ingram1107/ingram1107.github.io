# Directed Graph

Directed #[202204112045](202204112045.md) or *digraph* recognises the ordering of vertices in a
pair. This means that the edge $(u, v)$ is different from the edge $(v, u)$ as
in the first case $u$ is pointing to $v$ and in the second case, $v$ is pointing
to $u$ instead. It is useful to represent a dense graph.

If $(v, v)$ exists in the graph, this means that the graph is a *loop*.

A directed graph is *acyclic* if it has no cycle. Sometimes it will be referred
to as DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

A directed graph is *strongly connected* if there is a path from every vertex to
every other vertex. It is *weakly connected* if the graph is connected with the
edges (strip off the direction and treat it as an [202204112129](202204112129.md)).

To calculate the shortest path for each vertex to each other vertices, see
[202204141149](202204141149.md)#.
