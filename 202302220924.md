# The Structure of a Programming Language

The structure of a programming language can be categorised into two elements:
syntax (the form of its expressions, statements, and program units) and
semantics (the meaning of those expressions, statements, and program units). The
lowest syntactic unit of a language is called *lexemes*, usually a symbol or
single string. *Token* indicates the categories the lexemes belong to. The
syntax can be described by Backus-Naur Form (BNF). The language is formally
defined by either recognition or generation. By recognition, there will be
recogniser device ([syntax analyser](202302152015.md) in compiler) that reads
strings and check whether they are in the set of legal alphabets. By generation,
the language generator will generate sentences of the language.
