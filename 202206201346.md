# Validation and Verification of System Requirements

As the name suggests, Validation and Verification of System Requirements is to
[validate](202304302152.md) and [verify](202304302155.md) whether the system is
adhered to the [user's need](202303251328.md) and [Functional Requirements](202303251342.md)
of the system. This is quite handy in #[Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md).

There could be a discrepancy between the end-user access patterns and the test
data gathered by the developers. **Notice their differences**, and study how and
why they differ from each other.

#[Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md) recommending both
[Verification](202304302137.md) and [Validation](202304302143.md) and
[Usability Testing](202206201428.md) to be done as early as possible.
