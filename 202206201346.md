# Validation and Verification of System Requirements

As the name suggests, Validation and Verification of System Requirements is to validate and verify whether the system is adhered to the user's need and functional requirements of the system. This is quite handy in #[202206201159](202206201159.md).

There could be a discrepancy between the end-user access patterns and the test data gathered by the developers. **Notice their differences**, and study how and why they differ from each other.

#[202206201159](202206201159.md) recommends to do both Validation and Verification and [202206201428](202206201428.md) as early as possible.
