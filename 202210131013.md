# Simple Secret Key Distribution

Simple Secret Key Distribution, invented by Merkle in 1979, is an
#[Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md) used to #[distribute private key](202210062203.md).
There is a security risk where the [intruder](202209281128.md) can intercept and
impersonate both halves of the protocol. The process works as follows:
1. Person A will generate a new pair of temporary public key
2. Person A sends person B the public key with their identity
3. Person B generates a session key K, encrypts the key using the supplied
   public key, and sends it to person A.
4. Person A decrypts the session key K using the public key, thus successfully
   distribute the secret key to both side.
