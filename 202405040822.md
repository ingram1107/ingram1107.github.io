# Priority Ceiling Protocol (PCP)

PCP is a [Resource Access Control Protocol](202405040805.md) that defines
priority ceiling to each resource, that is the highest priority possible to use
the resource. It assumes that the resource requirement of every task is known a
priori. When a task is trying to lock a new resource, the new resource's
priority ceiling must be higher than of any pre-empted resources for the lock to
be successful. In other words, it can only acquire the lock when it is holding
the resources whose has the equal priority ceiling to the new resource. This
scenario is applicable only to those task that has lower priority or equal
priority comparing to the new resource's.

In addition to the blocking that [Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP)](202405040809.md)
has, which are direct blocking and priority inheritance blocking, PCP also
defines priority ceiling blocking. These blocking prevents chained blocking,
thus avoiding the occurrence of [Deadlocks](202202191853.md), and eliminates
[Unbounded Priority Inversion](202405040759.md).

PCP has the downside of several overheads due to calculation on resource
priority ceiling and system priority ceiling and extra context switches (cause
by pre-emption).
