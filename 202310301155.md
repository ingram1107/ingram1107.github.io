# Protein Threading/Fold Recognition

Protein threading is a [sequence-structure alignment](202308161006.md) that is
used for proteins that share folds, but don't necessarily
[Homologous](202308160957.md). It [predicts](202310291139.md) through
identification of good sequence-structure fit. It is used to model those
[proteins](202308082207.md) with the same fold as proteins of known structures,
but don't homologous proteins with known structure. Protein threading can test
whether the target protein adopts a known fold or unknown topology. Fitness
scoring function is used to select the best sequence-fold alignment.

**Note**: In protein threading, template is treated as structure.

Protein threading first constructs a [structure template database](202308152117.md).
Then, it finds out the design of the scoring function. After that, it does
the threading alignment by aligning target sequence with each of the structure
template. Last but not least, protein threading does the threading prediction
and chooses the most probable one.

This method is not suitable for drug design or protein-protein docking. However,
it is precise enough to determine patches of surface residues and for directing
protein-engineering experiments.
