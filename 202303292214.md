# Cellular Network

Cellular network is enabled by advancement from microprocessor (possible
implementation of complex #algorithm) and digital control links between the base
station and [mobile unit](202303292141.md) (increase control of system,
available more sophisticated services). It typically consists of Mobile
Telephone Switching Centre (MTSC) at least one [Mobile Switching Centre (MSC)](202305081828.md),
that connects to the base transceiver stations (BTSs) of the cells and Public
Switched Telephone Network (PTSN).
