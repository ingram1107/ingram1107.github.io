# Cellular Network

Cellular network is enabled by advancement from microprocessor (possible
implementation of complex #algorithm) and digital control links between the base
station and [mobile unit](202303292141.md) (increase control of system,
available more sophisticated services). It typically consists of Mobile
Telephone Switching Centre (MTSC) at least one [Mobile Switching Centre (MSC)](202305081828.md),
that connects to the base transceiver stations (BTSs) of the cells and Public
Switched Telephone Network (PTSN).

In a cellular network, each area is divided into cells, each with its own
antenna and ranges of frequencies which is served by base station that consists
of transmitter, receiver, and control unit. Adjacent cells are on different
frequencies, and cells are grouped into a cluster with arbitrary size $n$. The
below figure shows a cluster of size 7. [Frequency Reuse Pattern](202305081328.md)
is deployed in different clusters. When there is a need to add more users into
the network, smaller cells like microcells can be used.

Interference and cross-talking can be a major issue in cellular network. To
prevent them, we can use a buffer of at least one cell before
[reuse](202305081328.md), uses different frequencies on adjacent cells, and
limit transmission power at that frequency escaping to adjacent cells.

That being said, cellular networking has several issues need to be addressed
regarding [frequency allocation](202302161842.md) (licensed spectrum and
allocation to multiple providers), [multiple access](202304262143.md), location
management (high [Mobility](202303292141.md), multiple suppliers, [hand-off management](202305111947.md)
and [roaming](202303021542.md)), and different handling methods among different
generations.
