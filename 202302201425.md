# T.120 Protocol

T.120 protocol, developed by International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
defines the methods of document conferencing and application sharing or data
conferencing within a [multimedia conference](202302201418.md). It specified how
to efficiently and reliably distribute files and graphical information in real
time during a conference. It ensures interoperability between end terminals in
the absence of prior knowledge of the other terminals. T.120 can be integrated
and used with [H.323 Protocol](202302201420.md).
