# Addressing Increasing of Cellular Network Capacity

To address the increasing [Network Capacity](202304191208.md) of [Cellular Network](202303292214.md),
we can take the approaches of **adding new channels**, **frequency borrowing**
(taken from adjacent cells by congested cells), **cell splitting** (high usage
cell split into smaller ones), **cell sectoring** (cell divided into a number of
wedge-shaped sectors, each with their own set of channels), and **microcells**
(moves antenna to higher places).
