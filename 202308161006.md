# Sequence Alignment

Sequence alignment analyses many [DNA](202308082154.md) and
[protein](202308082207.md) sequences to identify domains or motifs shared among
a group of molecules. It could be improved by implementing a scoring system to
compare different alignments and include penalties to prevent unreasonable
number of insertions. Alignment aids in establishing evolutionary relationship
by constructing a phylogenetic tree.

Alignment could be done globally or locally. Global alignment forces alignment
to span the entire length of all query sequences. Local alignment is often
preferable due to the divergent nature of sequences, but because of the
challenge of identifying the regions of similarity, it could be more difficult
to calculate.
