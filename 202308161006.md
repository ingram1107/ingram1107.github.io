# Sequence Alignment

Sequence alignment analyses many [DNA](202308082154.md) and
[protein](202308082207.md) sequences to identify domains or motifs shared among
a group of molecules. It could be improved by implementing a scoring system to
compare different alignments and include penalties to prevent unreasonable
number of insertions. Alignment aids in establishing evolutionary relationship
by constructing a phylogenetic tree.
