# Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detect Protocol (CSMA/CD)

CSMA/CD is an #[202207051550](202207051550.md) protocol aimed to resolve *collisions* between computers when sharing the #[data link](202206131651.md). It defines how a computer should listen to the network before transmitting. The computer can transmit the data if the network is quiet. Otherwise, the computer will back off from the collisions (they will be detected by the protocol) and try to retransmit that data with a random timer.
