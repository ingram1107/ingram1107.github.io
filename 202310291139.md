# Protein Structure Prediction

The prediction can be formulated as a search problem for the global minimum free
energy of a folded [protein](202308082207.md), but the search space is enormous
and the number of local minima increases exponentially. Protein structures are
determined by several factors including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, van
der Waal forces that needed to stabilise the hydrophobic cores, and
electrostatic forces in which the oppositely charged side chains form salt
bridges. This problem can be partially bypassed in:
- [*Ab initio* Protein Modelling](202310291649.md),
- and [Comparative/Homology Modelling and Protein Threading](202310291653.md)

Tertiary structure prediction can be progressed in stages. In the first stage,
the #algorithm does the backbone prediction using [any](202310291649.md),
[methods](202310291653.md). Then, it will enter loop modelling. The third stage
packs the side-chain. In the last stage, the predicted structure will be
refined.
