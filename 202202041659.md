# Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA)

PATA disks use parallel interface to transfer data over the connected cable.
Typically, one PATA connector could connect up to two PATA disks.

Depends on the *jumper* position, PATA disks could be configured as masters or
as slaves. Mordern PATA disks usually can configure themselves automatically
based on their connected cable position by using an option call *cable select*.

PATA disks performance range from 128 to 1,064 Mbps.

PATA is succeeded by [SATA](202202041834.md)#.
