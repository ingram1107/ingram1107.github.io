# Recurrent ANN Connection

A recurrent [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](202309091335.md) does form a
directed cycle. This allows the creation of an internal state of network which
allows dynamic temporal behaviours can process arbitrary sequences of inputs.

Types of recurrent ANN connection are:
- Competitive networks
- Kohonen's SOM
- Hopefield network
- ART models
