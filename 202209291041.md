# Channel Encoder

Channel Encoder is a machine or software responsible for adding redundant bits
to #[source code words](202209291038.md) in order to transform them into
**channel code words** which could be reliably transmitted in a potential *noisy
channel*. It will usually proceed to [Modulator](202209291044.md)#.

At the receiver end, Channel Encoder will transform the received channel code
words into estimated source code words and pass them to #[Source Encoder](202209291038.md).
In practice, [Error Control Coding](202211032201.md) may be used in order to
achieve acceptable performance.
