# Ring

Ring is a [Set](202204281446.md)# $R$, together with two operations $+$ and $*$,
which has the following properties including those in #[Group](202210082221.md)
and #[Abelian Group](202210082309.md):
- Closure under multiplication, which means if $a, b \in S$, then $ab$ is also
  in $S$.
- Associativity of multiplication, which means $\forall a, b, c \in S, a(bc) =
  (ab)c$.
- Distributive laws, which means $\forall a, b, c \in S, a(b + c) = ab + ac$ and
  $(a + b)c = ac + bc$.

If the multiplicative operation is commutative, then it forms [Communicative Ring](202210082310.md)#.

If the multiplicative operation has an identity and no zero divisors, it forms
[Integral Domain](202210082323.md)#.
