# Block Code

Block Code is a message sequence that is subdivided into sequential blocks each
$k$ bits long (message bits), and each $k$-bit block is mapped into a $n$-bit
block (codeword bits), where $n > k$. The number of [redundant](202209291049.md)
bits added by the encoder to each transmitted block is $n - k$ bits which is
related to $k$ message bits. Thus, we can calculate the [code rate](202210052143.md)#.
