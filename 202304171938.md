# Traditional System Development

Traditional system is designed to run on [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md)
and [Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) and is influenced by
#hardware and/or #software compatibility issues. Such system usually utilise
Internet links and resources and treat web-based features as merely an
enhancement. Many applications require rather large desktop computing power and
resources, and the system scaling muchly limited by the network limitations and
constraints. However, it has less complex #security concerns over [web-based system](202304171942.md).
