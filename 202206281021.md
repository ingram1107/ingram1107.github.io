# IP Address

An IP Address is a network address that is assigned by the local network using
#[Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md). Unlike [Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md),
it is temporary and can be easily changed. In the local network, the IP address
must be unique.

The address could be assigned via static method or [dynamic method](202206151645.md)#.
For general case, devices that don't move too much such as servers,
[Router](202207061800.md)# and [Switch](202207051907.md)# are assigned with
static IP address. Mobile devices like laptop and smartphone should be using
dynamic method to get the IP address instead.

There are currently two versions of IP Address:
- [202206151453](202206151453.md)# (older version, 32-bit)
- [202206281129](202206281129.md)# (replacement of IPv4, 128-bit)

Some interfaces, such as [Network Interface Card (NIC)](202210012104.md)# and
[Router's](202207061800.md)# [Ethernet](202207051550.md) or serial interface,
are could be assigned with an IP Address.
