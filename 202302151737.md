# Universal Instantiation

Universal Instantiation is a form of [Argument](202205062050.md) where the truth
of a property in a particular case follows as a special instance of its more
general or universal truth. For example, if all men are mortal and Socrates is a
man, then we can conclude that Socrates is mortal.
