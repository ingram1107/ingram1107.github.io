# Conversational Mechanism

The following lists example of conversational mechanism procedure:
1. mutual meetings
2. adjacency pairs (paired utterances, that is speakers, where the first one
   sets up an expectation on the conversation's direction)
3. turn talking (the current speaker chooses the next speaker by asking an
   opinion, question, or request. If not, another person decides to start
   speaking. If not, the current speaker continues talking)
4. farewell rituals
5. back channelling (signal to continue and following)
6. implicit and explicit cues (close conversation)

Breakdown could occur due to silence or misunderstanding. It could be repaired
by repeating with emphasis (stronger voice, harder intonation, more exaggerate
gesture, capital letter etc.) or signals and tokens (What?).
