# Pure Function

Pure Function in mathematical sense is a function that has *no side effect*,
does not *change the state of the program* and always *produces the same
results* when given the *same arguments*. I think that pure function is adhered
to the concept of [orthogonality](lit/@Hunt1999.md)#.

It is emphasised heavily in #[202203061121](202203061121.md).
