# Design Guideline

Guideline can be seen as advice on how to achieve a standard. It is a suggestive
and general [Design Rule](202305151505.md), in other words, it is a broad brush
design rule that is not always applicable. Nevertheless, understanding its
justification aids in conflict resolution, and it can be a useful checklist.
Abstract guidelines like [principles](202304081741.md) should be applied during
[early life cycle activities](202303251009.md) whereas detailed guidelines like
style guides should be applied during later life cycle activities.

Examples of design guideline are:
- Nielsen's 10 Heuristics
- [Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules](202305151452.md)
- [Norman's 7 Principles](202305151500.md)
