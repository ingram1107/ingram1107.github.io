# Software Process Engineering (SPE)

SPE creates #performance models for critical [use case scenarios](202304011421.md)
which are normal scenarios that are performed frequently. These scenarios could
be represented with sequence diagram. In SPE, we have to specify the
*performance objectives* (quantitative), such as response time,
[Throughput](202304111957.md), resource usage constraints etc., and *workload
criteria* (arrival rate), like number of URL requests, number of [concurrent users](202202011815.md).
