# Fileless Malware

Fileless Malware is a form of malware that doesn't write anything to disk or
hard drive. The payloads are read, in a form of HTTP request[^proofpoint2016],
and executed by other applications, usually a shell, or framework such as
command prompt, PowerShell or .NET framework. Since the malware is directly put
into memory, it is rather hard for antivirus to detect it with conventional
means of anti-analysis techniques. In addition, it is tremendously hard to
differentiate a legitimate process and a malicious process by just looking at
the process tree. Some even stored themselves inside registry, which could put
into main memory every time after system boot up.

It is particular popular in Powerware campaign and high profile DNC hack.
