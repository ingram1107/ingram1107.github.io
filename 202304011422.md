# UML Activity Diagram

Activity diagram in [Unified Modelling Language (UML)](202304011211.md) shows
the [System](202303242148.md) workflow and the interaction between the user and
the #software. It is pretty similar to flowchart. It serves as a complement to
[UML Use Case Diagram](202304011421.md) for more details, therefore there can be
multiple activity diagrams to describe a use case diagram. Elipses represent
actions, diamonds represent decisions (a true condition with an else) or merges
(merge lines, accept multiple input with only one output), and bars represent
the start or end of tasks [concurrent execution](202202011815.md).
