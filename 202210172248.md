# File Descriptor

A unique File Descriptor is assigned to an opened file in order for Unix or
Unix-like operating system such as #[Linux](202204081225.md) to identify it.
There are some default file descriptors reserved for system usage:
- 0 is used by standard input
- 1 is used for standard output
- 2 is used for standard error
