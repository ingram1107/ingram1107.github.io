# File Descriptor

A unique File Descriptor is assigned to an opened file in order for Unix or
Unix-like operating system such as #[Linux](202204081225.md) to identify it. It
is a pointer to the kernel's file table, which is a vector, to indicate that
particular file, thus the file descriptors can be different across different
processes, but still pointing to the same file. There are some default file
descriptors reserved for system usage:
- 0 is used by standard input
- 1 is used for standard output
- 2 is used for standard error
