# The Quotient-Remainder Theorem

Given any integer $n$ and positive integer $d$, there exist unique integers
$q$ and $r$ such that:

$$
n = dq + r \text{ and } 0 \le r < d
$$

The above statement can be understood as the possible remainders can be $0, 1,
2, \ldots, (d-1)$, which implies that $n$ can be written as one of the forms
$dq, dq + 1, dq + 2, \ldots, dq + (d-1)$ for some integer $q$.
