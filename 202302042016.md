# HMAC

HMAC is essentially a combination of [Message Authentication Code (MAC)](202212291225.md)
and [Hash Function](202112122038.md), that is a hash includes a key along with
message. It is standardised in RFC2104, defined as below:

$$
HMAC_K = H[(K^+ \oplus opad)||H[(K^+ \oplus ipad)||M]]
$$

Where:
- $K^+$ is the key padded out to size
- $opad$ and $ipad$ are specified padding constants

The security of the HMAC relies on the security of the underlying hash function
used.
