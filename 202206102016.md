# Elimination

Elimination is a valid form of #[Argument](202205062050.md) where one must
be the case when the other has been ruled out. It includes two premises and a
conclusion (similar to [Syllogism](202206101739.md)), shown in the following:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \lor q \\
&\sim q \\
\therefore \ &p
\end{align}
$$

Let's say today's is either raining or sunny. If it is not sunny, it must be
raining then.
