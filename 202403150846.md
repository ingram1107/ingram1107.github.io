# Fully Buffered DRAM (FB-DRAM)

FB-DRAM shares [DDR2](202403150636.md) modules with the difference of using
serial bus connection which is fully duplex and can be driven to higher
frequency. The utilisation of serial bus brings the benefits that FB-DRAM allows
more module per channel, more channel per Northbridge or memory controller.
Excluding address pins and power pins, it has only 69 pins. The electrical
signal is minimally delayed at each DIMM in chain which resulted in the increase
of [Latency](202304111955.md), but it should be of no concern.
