# Traffic Engineering

Traffic engineering provides explicit routing service for [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md).
This means that it creates independent [LSPs](202305032308.md) and specifies
different paths based on user-defined policies. Extensive operator intervention
may be required. [RSVP-TE](202305040735.md) and [CR-LDP](202305040737.md) are
two possible approaches to supply dynamic traffic engineering in MPLS network.
