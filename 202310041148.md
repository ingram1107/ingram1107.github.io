# Perl Regular Expression

We could either match, substitute, or transliterate the pattern with the
[Perl](202302190715.md)'s regular expression syntax of `m`, `s`, or `tr`
respectively. To match (`=~`) or unmatch (`!~`), we can write the regular
expression like the following code:

```perl
# Example for regex matching
my $email = "This is a grant Free Offer";
if ($email =~ m/Free Offer/) {
    $email = "*deleted spam*\n";
}
print "$email\n";

# Example for regex substitution
my $book = "The book is Das Kapital\n";
$book =~ s/Das Kapital/L'etat et La Revolution/;
print "$book\n";

# Example for regex transliteration
my $secret = "This is my password key";
$secret =~ tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/;
print "encrypted: $secret\n";

$secret =~ tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/;
print "dencrypted: $secret\n";
```

Perl captured value will always be the previous captured even if the regular
expression fails to match the string pattern. We could check whether a pattern
has been capture via `||` operator.

**Note**: To group a pattern but not to capture it, we can use the syntax
`(?:)`.

Disabling greediness could be done via `?` syntax after any quantifier.

See more in `perldoc perlre`. `Regexp::Common` also provides additional tools
for regex matching. `Parse::RecDescent` can be used to define complex grammar
rule if regex is not suitable for the task.
