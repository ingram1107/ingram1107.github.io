# Perl Regular Expression

We could either match, substitute, or transliterate the pattern with the
[Perl](202302190715.md)'s regular expression syntax of `m`, `s`, or `tr`
respectively. To match (`=~`) or unmatch (`!~`), we can write the regular
expression like the following code:

```perl
# Example for regex matching
my $email = "This is a grant Free Offer";
if ($email =~ m/Free Offer/) {
    $email = "*deleted spam*\n";
}
print "$email\n";

# Example for regex substitution
my $book = "The book is Das Kapital\n";
$book =~ s/Das Kapital/L'etat et La Revolution/;
print "$book\n";

# Example for regex transliteration
my $secret = "This is my password key";
$secret =~ tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/;
print "encrypted: $secret\n";

$secret =~ tr/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/;
print "dencrypted: $secret\n";
```
