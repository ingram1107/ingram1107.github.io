# Reference Cycle

Reference Cycle is a phenomenon in Rust when the reference count from #[202206221720](202206221720.md) can't go down to 0 because references are referring or pointing to each other. Since the reference count of `Rc<T>` is never going to be 0, it will not be clean up by Rust in runtime, in turn cause memory leak (unused memory). This is quite common when the codebase use [202206232210](202206232210.md)# with a combination of `Rc<T>` (in the form of `RefCell<Rc<T>>`).

Suggested solutions from the official Rust book is to detect it with automated #test, code review or data structure reorganisation to either express ownership (avoid `RefCell<T>` at all cost) or not at all (use [202206251329](202206251329.md)# instead of `Rc<T>`).
