# External Sorting

External Sorting is a sorting algorithm that focus on handling file that stored
in a tertiary storage especially in a limited memory machine. Most algorithms
involve [202202261001](202202261001.md)# or a combination of it with other sorting algorithms.

We will use passes instead of running time to measure the efficiency of those
algorithms since I/O access is much are costlier than of RAM access. We need to
make as little I/O access as possible.

These algorithms are:
- [202203102127](202203102127.md)#
- [202203102233](202203102233.md)#
- [202203110931](202203110931.md)#
