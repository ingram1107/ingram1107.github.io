# Source Encoder

Source Encoder is a machine or software responsible for compressing the
[Information](202209291015.md)# to **source code word** by removing redundant
bits. Removing those redundant bits actually make the transmission process for
efficient as uses less resources to produce the same or more output. It will
usually proceed to [Channel Encoder](202209291041.md)#.

At the receiver side, Source Encoder will atttempt to decompress the source code
words into the original message signal.

Source Encoder is expected to satisfy two requirements: (1) code words are in
*binary form* and (2) source code is *uniquely decodable*.
