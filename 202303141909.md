# Pipelining

Pipelining is a networking technique that transmits multiple packets without
waiting for acknowledgements from the receiver. The consequences of having
pipelining is the need to increase the range of the sequence number, buffer for
more than one packet, and error recovery. [Go-Back-N (GBN) protocols](202303141912.md)
and [selective repeat (SR) protocols](202303211253.md) can be implemented for
error recovery.
