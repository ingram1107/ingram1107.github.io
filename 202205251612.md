# Git Fetch

`fetch` is a #[202205251209](202205251209.md) command which downloads remote repository's
commits onto the local repository if there is no [merge](202204261123.md)#
conflicts.

Although we can use refspecs like in [202205251600](202205251600.md) and [202204262031](202204262031.md)#, it
is recommended to not do so.
