# Perfect Forwarding

In some situation, we might want to preserve the value type of the arguments
during #[forwarding](202203291824.md) instead of toss away it after entering the
local scope.

We could use the function `std::forward` imported from `<utility>`.
`std::forward`, like `std::move`, move the value without copying. However,
unlike `std::move`, it moves the value conditionally, meaning it will preserve
the value type of the passed value. If the value type of the passed value is
lvalue, `std::forward` will forward it as lvalue. If it is rvalue,
`std::forward` will forward it as rvalue.

In such way, we will not need to worry about the value type that passed to the
function.
