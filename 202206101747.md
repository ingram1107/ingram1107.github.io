# Modus Ponens

Modus ponens, means "method of affirming" in Latin, is a form of #[202206101739](202206101739.md) which the conclusion is an affirmation. The form can be seen in the following:

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{If } p \text{ then } q \\
&p \\
\therefore \ &q
\end{align}
$$

It can be proved to be valid by examining its #[critical row](202205062050.md) using [202205061151](202205061151.md).

$p$ | $q$ | $p \rightarrow q$ | $p$ | $q$
