# Thread Creation in Pthread

To create thread using Pthread library, we need to declare a `pthread_t`
variable and then call `pthread_create`, to construct the thread and execute it,
and `pthread_join`, to terminate the thread. Note that we need to handle the
fail cases from `pthread_create` and `pthread_join` with `if` clause.

```c
pthread_t th;

if (pthread_create(&th, NULL, &routine, NULL) != 0)
  perror("Fail to create thread");
if (pthread_join(th, NULL) != 0)
  perror("Fail to join thread");
```

**Note**: Treat `pthread_t` like an opaque type as it could be any type depends
on which function it had been called to. Even though it could sometime return
the thread's identity, **DO NOT RELY ON THIS BEHAVIOUR**. Call
`syscall(SYS_gettid)` in Linux instead.

## Multiple Threads

Multiple threads' creation should be done in a `for` loop to avoid repetition. Be
cautious that `pthread_create` and `pthread_join` should not reside in the same
loop. Otherwise, we will lose all the multithreading advantages.

```c
int numOfThreads = 5;
pthread_t th[numOfThreads];

for (int i = 0; i < numOfThreads; i++)
  if (pthread_create(th+i, NULL, &routine, NULL) != 0)
    perror("Fail to create thread");

for (int i = 0; i < numOfThreads; i++)
  if (pthread_join(*(th+i), NULL) != 0)
    perror("Fail to join thread");
```

## Thread Detachment

## Exit

If `pthread_exit` is used in the main function, the main process will simply
be terminated without waiting for the termination of the threads created by it.
