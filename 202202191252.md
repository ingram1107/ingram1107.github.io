# Compound Literal

Compound Literal can be defined in macro to express a constant with a certain
type other than `signed int`.

```c
#define CONSTANT /**/     \
(char const * const[3]) { \
  "First",                \
  "Second",               \
  "Third",                \
}
```

**Note**: `/**/` is necessary here as it distinguish compound literal from
*function-like macro*.
