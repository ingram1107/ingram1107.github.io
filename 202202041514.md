# SOLID

## Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> The single responsibility principle states that every **module** or **class**
> should have **responsibility** over **a single part** of the **functionality**
> provide by the software, and that responsibility should be **entirely
> encapsulated** by the class, module or function. All its services should be
> narrowly aligned with that responsibility[^wikipedia-srp].

> Everything should do just one thing

> **Orthogonality**: ... We want to design components that are
> **self-contained**: **independent**, and with a single, well-defined
> **purpose** (\[...\] **cohesion**). When components are *isolated* from one
> another, you know that you can **change** one **without** having to worry
> about the **rest**. [@Hunt1999](lit/@Hunt1999.md)

> **Cohesion** is a measure of the **strength of association** of the
> **elements** inside a **module**. A highly cohesive module is a collection of
> statements and data items that should be treated as a whole because they are
> so **closely related**. Any attempt to divide them up would only result in
> increased coupling and decreased readability[^demacro-1979].

> A class should have **only one reason** to **change**[^martin-2003]

SRP brings two benefits: [@Hunt1999](lit/@Hunt1999.md)
1. Gain on productivity
2. Reduction of risk

We can improve the overall team productivity since the development and testing
time for small components are relative short compare to larger counterparts.
Smaller module means lesser code, easier to design and simpler to do [unit
test](202206201320.md). Therewith, such component has great usability because it
has a specific and well-tested responsibility, plus it doesn't overlap with
other modules.

In [debugging](202203131236.md) sense, the job become simpler. Base on the fact
that the component is rather isolated from the rest of the codebase, the
symptoms are likely to be contained in one area. These components have a high
chance to be well-tested since the tests themselves are not sophisticated.
Besides the simplification of debugging process, this will reduce the reliance
on particular vendor, product, or platform since the interface of them are
insulated from the rest of the codebase.

**Guideline**: Prefer cohesive software entities. Everything that does not
strictly belong together, should be separated.[^iglberger-2020]

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software artefacts (classes, modules, functions etc.) should be **open for
> extension**, but **closed for modification**.[^meyer-1997]

The main approach is procedural which is moving the corresponding member
function to the outer scope and make it a non-member or free function.

Dynamic polymorphism with *code injection* and *metaclasses* could work on
Object-Oriented approach without breaking SRP.[^brand-2020]

**Guideline**: Prefer software design that allows the addition of types or
operations without the need to modify existing code.[^iglberger-2020]

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> What is wanted here is something like the following substitution property: If
> for each object o1, of type S there is an object o2 of the type T such that
> for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when
> o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T.[^liskov-1988]

It is essentially about the **behavioural** [Interface Inheritance/Subtyping](202302042025.md),
or IS-A relationship. The basic characteristics of this relationship are:
- Contravariance (more derived type could change the property defined in less
  derived type) of **method arguments** in a subtype
- Covariance (less derived type could change the property defined in more
  derived type) of **return types** in a subtype
- **Preconditions** cannot be strengthened in a subtype
- **Postconditions** cannot be weakened in a subtype
- **Invariants** of super type must be preserved in a subtype

We can strengthen or even enforce the checking of these conditions using
[202206301938](202206301938.md)#.

**Guideline**:[^iglberger-2020]
- Make sure that inheritance is about behaviour not about data.
- Make sure that the contract of base types is adhered to.
- Make sure to adhere to the required concept.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not
> use.[^martin-2003]

> Many client specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose
> interface.[^wikipedia-isp]

Write shy codes: don't reveal yourself to others, and don't interact with too
many people. [The Pragmatic Programmer](lit/@Hunt1999.md) By that, the
interaction between the modules or interfaces is limited so if one get
comprised, the others remained unaffected. Make sure the implementation of the
interface is adhered to the [202207031635](202207031635.md)#.

**Guideline**: Make sure interfaces don't induce unnecessary
dependencies[^iglberger-2020]

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) tells us that the most flexible
> systems are those in which source code dependencies refer only to
> abstractions, not to concretions.[^martin-2017]

> a. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
> depend on abstractions
> 
> b. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on
> abstractions.[^martin-2003]

Make a local inversion of dependencies in the lower level abstraction and then
move it to the higher level abstraction. The user should not directly interact
with low level modules, instead they should rely on a general contractor with
high abstractions, that encapsulate such dependencies, and use the module on the
user's behalf. [The Pragmatic Programmer](lit/@Hunt1999.md) See more in
[202207041054](202207041054.md)# or [202207041156](202207041156.md)#.

**Guideline:** Prefer to depend on abstractions (i.e. abstract classes or
concepts) instead of concrete types.[^iglberger-2020]
