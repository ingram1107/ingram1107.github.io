# Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

EAP is a framework used to carry [Authentication](202210040915.md) information
in any of several formats, which means that the information can be in passwords
or security keys. It typically rides on top of other protocols such as
[802.1x](202303082056.md), [Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md),
or [Diameter](202210221333.md).
