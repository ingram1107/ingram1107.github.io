# Bastion Host

Bastion Host is a system identified by #[Firewall](202210022249.md)
administrator as a critical *strong point* in the network's security. It should
be small, secure, independent, and non-priviledge. It serves as a platform for
[Application-Level Gateways](202301221202.md)# or
[Circuit-Level Gateways](202301221209.md)#, or provides externally accessible
services. Since it could be exposed to hostile attacks, it should be secured by
hardened OS, essential services, and extra [Authentication](202210022151.md). It
may be trusted to enforce policy of trusted separation between these network
connections.
