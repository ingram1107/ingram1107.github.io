# Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

SMTP is an [Application Layer](202206131856.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md),
defined in RFC 2821, to transfer electronic mail over Internet
[reliably](202206151232.md). It's listen to the [port](202206151841.md) 25. It
uses persistent connections as it transfers all email at once over a single TCP
connection. SMTP is a push protocol, meaning the sender will periodically push
the message to the receiver until either the receiver notify it has received or
discarded after a time period. RFC 822 specifies the format for mail header
lines as well as body that should be separated by `CRLF` blank line like the
following:

```
From: ingram@test.org
To: alice@edu.my
Subject: Hello World
```

By default, SMTP only allows the transfer of ASCII encoded data. To allow
multimedia files to be transferred over SMTP, [Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)](202211012200.md)
should be considered.
