# Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

Assuming that the [Relation](202204282024.md) schema $R$ is in BCNF with respect
to a set of $F$ of [Functional Dependencies](202308291830.md) if, for all
functional dependencies in $F^+$ of the form $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ where
$\alpha \subseteq R$ and $\beta \subseteq R$. It must satisfy the following two
conditions:
1. $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ is a trivial functional dependency, that is,
   $\beta \subseteq \alpha$.
2. $\alpha$ is a superkey for schema $R$.

Following this rule, we could decompose a non-BCNF relation schema $R$ with
$\alpha \cup \beta$ and then $R - (\beta - \alpha)$. That being said, BCNF is
not dependency preserving, for that purpose, [Third Normal Form (3NF)](202310171008.md)
is a better choice.
