# Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC)

DMC is a #[communication channel](202210042126.md) having two alphabets
(source): input $X$ and output $Y$ which has the following characteristics:
- $x$ and $y$ are random variables
- $y$ is a noisy version of $x$
- in each signalling interval the channel accepts $x$ from $X$ as input, and
  emits $y$ from $Y$ as output
- both $X$ and $Y$ have finite sizes since it is [discrete](202209291056.md)#
- the current output only depends on current input since it is
  [memoryless](202209291056.md)#
- $X$ and $Y$ don't necessarily have the same size

It can be represented using [Channel Matrix](202210261214.md)#.

There are some special cases of DMC
- [Lossless Channel](202210261248.md)#
- [Deterministic Channel](202210261251.md)#
- [Noiseless Channel](202210261253.md)#
- [Binary Symmetric Channel](202210261256.md)#
