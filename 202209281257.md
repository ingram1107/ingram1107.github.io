# Cryptanalytic Attack

Cryptanalytic Attack is performed based on the nature of the
[cryptographic](202209281121.md) #algorithm with the complement from the general
characteristic of the plaintext. It is essentially finding a relationship
between the plaintext and the ciphertext. Some #[Cryptanalysts](202209281128.md)
would use the sample plaintext-ciphertext pairs in aid on cracking the algorithm
down. The purpose of the Cryptanalytic Attack is to find the relationship
between the information that the cryptanalyst has obtained.

The goal of a Cryptanalytic Attack, rank from highest security threat to lowest,
is to:
- have a *total break* of the encryption scheme, that is getting hold of the
  private or decryption key
- to *decrypt some ciphertexts*
- to *distinguish pairs of ciphertexts* based on the message

With the assumption that the algorithm is [known](202209281156.md)#, ranked from
weak to strong, the intruder could carry out efficient attack if they have
obtained the information of:
- only ciphertext (COA)
- known/suspect plaintext (KPA)
- chosen plaintext, where the intruder obtained the *encryption oracle* (black
  box), which the plaintext could be used to produce ciphertext (e.g.,
  [Differential Cryptanalysis Attack](202210132150.md)#,
  [Integral Cryptanalysis Attack](202210132153.md)#) (CPA)
- chosen ciphertext, where the intruder obtained the *decryption oracle*, which
  the ciphertext could be used to produce plaintext (CCA)
- chosen text, where the intruder obtained the *cryptographic oracle*, that is
  the entire system, which can produce either plaintext or ciphertext (CTA)

Other than the above attacks, there are some more attacks utilising different
characteristic of the encryption scheme:

- [Man-In-The-Middle Attack](202210132201.md)#
- [Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)#
- [Kasiski Method](202210302317.md)#
- [Analytic Attacks](202212172229.md)#
