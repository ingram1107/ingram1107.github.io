# Rational Number

A real number $r$ is **rational**, if, and only if, it can be expressed as a
quotient of two integers with a *non-zero denominator*. A real number that is not
rational is **irrational**. This statement can be expressed
[formally](202204281244.md):

$$
r \text{ is rational } \Leftrightarrow \exists \text{ integers } a \text{ and }
b \text{ such that } r = \frac{a}{b} \text{ and } b \not = 0.
$$
