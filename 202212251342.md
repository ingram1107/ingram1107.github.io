# VLAN Trunking

In VLAN Trunking, a *tag* will assign to the [frame](202206131651.md) to
indicate their #[Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md) belonging which is handled
by either a switch or a router. After the frame passed through a trunk link, the
tag will be removed from the packet when it reaches the destination node or
non-trunk link, usually a switch.

There are currently two implementations for VLAN Trunking:
- Inter-Switch Link (ISL), Cisco legacy proprietary method
- [IEEE 802.1Q](202212251358.md)#
