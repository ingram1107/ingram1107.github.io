# VLAN Trunking

In VLAN Trunking, a *tag* will assign to the [frame](202206131651.md) to
indicate their #[Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md) belonging which is handled
by either a switch or a router. After the frame passed through a trunk link, the
tag will be removed from the packet when it reaches the destination node or
non-trunk link, usually a switch.

It is advised to have access ports when only a single port is connected to the
port, multiple devices that belongs to the same VLAN are connected to the port,
or the link only carry a single VLAN when there is another switch connected to
the interface. Trunk ports should be used when there is a need to carry multiple
VLANs.

There are currently two standards for VLAN Trunking:
- Inter-Switch Link (ISL), Cisco legacy proprietary method
- [IEEE 802.1Q](202212251358.md)#

**Note**: These two standards are incompatible to each other. If two
[Switch](202207051907.md)# support different standard and only that standard,
then it is not possible to establish a trunk link between them.
