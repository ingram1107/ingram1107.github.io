# Electronic Codebook (ECB)

ECB is a [block mode of operation](202209281239.md)# from
#[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md) and #[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)
where each block of plaintext bits is encoded using
[Substitution](202209281136.md)# [independently](202212291019.md)# with the same
key. The formal equation for the encryption is as follow:

$$
C_i = \text{ des}_{k1} (p_i)
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertext
- $\text{des}$ denotes #[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
  algorithm
- $k$ is the key
- $p$ is the plaintext

If the message is aligned with message block, especially with data such as
graphics or with messages the has insignificant change, message repetitions may
show in ciphertext. This could cause a *code-book analysis problem*. It is due
to the independence of the ciphertext blocks between each another.

It is typically used for secure transmission or [distribution](202210062203.md)#
of single values such as secret keys.
