# Types of RNA

Messenger RNA or **mRNA** is the template for protein synthesis or translation.
Transfer RNA or **tRNA** participates in protein synthesis. Ribosomal RNA or
**rRNA** is the major component of the ribosome which acts as a catalyst for
protein synthesis. Small nuclear RNA or **snRNA** participates in the splicing
of RNA exons. Micro RNA or **miRNA** binds to complementary mRNA and inhibits
its translation. Small interfering RNA or **siRNA** binds to mRNA and
facilitates their degradation.
