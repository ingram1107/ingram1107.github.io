# Shift Cipher

Shift Cipher or Caesar Cipher, named after Julius Caesar, is a simple
#[Substitution Cryptographic](202209281136.md) #algorithm that simply shifts one
letter of the alphabet to a set number of places in the alphabet for another
letter (by default, shift 3 places). For example, if the shift value is 4, this
means that the letter need to be shifted to the right 4 times, meaning the
letter "A" would be "E" in the ciphertext.

We could mathematically give every letter a number from 0 to 25 in English
alphabets. Then, we can have a Shift Cipher defined mathematically using the
formulas below:

$$
\begin{align}
C &= E_k(P) = P + k (\mod 26)
P &= D_k(C) = C + k (\mod 26)
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertext
- $P$ is the plaintext
- $E$ is the encryption algorithm
- $D$ is the decryption algorithm
- $k$ is the shift value

Since there is only 25 possible ciphers (English alphabets), it is vulnerable to
[Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md)#.

There are several examples of Shift Cipher:
- ROT13 cipher (shift 13 times)
