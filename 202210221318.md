# Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)

RADIUS is a #[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md) developed by
Livingston Enterprises in mid-1990s which provides centralised
#[Triple A (AAA)](202210221150.md) services to their network access server (NAS)
devices. It supports [Link Encryption](202210062110.md)# and maximum attribute
data size of 255 octets (8 bit). It has implicit support of agent support,
meaning the agent behaviours might be implemented in a RADIUS server. RADIUS
protocol is standardised by RFC 2138, RFC 2139, RFC 2865, RFC 2866 and RFC 2869.

The client from the user side will initiate a request to remote access server
(which could be NAS or other [Network Device](202207051821.md), that has RADIUS
client installed) to gain network access. The server will ask the user for
credentials, which the user will provide. It forwards the request alongside with
the authentication information to an AAA server, where it checks the information
against the database that stores user information (e.g., Active Directory,
Novell NetWare eDirectory, or UNIX NIS). The AAA server will return the success
or failure of the authentication to the RADIUS client (that is the NAS in this
case), and if it is a success, the remote access server will grant the network
access to the user client.

The peer discovery is done by static configuration which come out of short when
comparing to [Diameter](202210221333.md) which support dynamic lookup.
