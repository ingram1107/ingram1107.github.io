# Relationship Set

Relationship set is a [Set](202204281446.md) of [Relationship](202304192107.md)
of the same type. A relationship instance in a relationship set represents the
association between [Entities](202304191954.md). Let say there is a relationship
set $R$, we can say that it is a [Subset](202204281535.md) of $\{(e_1, e_2,
\ldots, e_n)|e_1 \in E_1, e_2 \in E_2, \ldots, e_n \in E_n\}$ where $(e_1, e_2,
\ldots, e_n)$ is a relationship. If $R$ doesn't have any attributes associated
with it, then $\text{primary key}(E_1) \cup \text{primary key}(E_2) \cup \ldots
\text{primary key}(E_n)$ describes an individual relationship in $R$. If there
are attributes attached to $R$, then $\text{primary key}(E_1) \cup \text{primary
key}(E_2) \cup \ldots \text{primary key}(E_n) \cup \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\}$
describes an individual relationship in $R$. From here, we can see that
$\text{primary key}(E_1) \cup \text{primary key}(E_2) \cup \ldots \text{primary
key}(E_n)$ from the [superkey](202302101331.md) for $R$.

Depending on the number of involving [Entity Set](202304191956.md), we can
determine the relationship set's degree. For example, a binary relationship set
is a degree 2 relationship set which involves 2 entity sets. Correspondingly, a
ternary relationship set is a degree 3 relationship set which involves 3 entity
sets.

A recursive relationship set is formed when there is the same entity set
participants in the same relationship set more than once in different
[roles](202304191954.md).
