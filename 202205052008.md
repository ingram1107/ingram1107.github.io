# Xft Font System

Xft Font System aims to replace #[202205051943](202205051943.md). It is client-based where
local applications can directly access [202205051728](202205051728.md) installed in the
computer. It also supports font smoothing and other advance typographic features
which improve the font rendering overall. You can tweak its configuration in the
file `/etc/fonts/local.conf`. Use `fc-cache` after making changes on the
configuration file.
