# Digital Divide

Digital divide is a phenomenon where there exists a disparity of ability of
technology to raise standard of living. In other words, it is a division between
those who have privilege to access to ICT and are using it adequately, and those
who do not. There are three types of digital divide: **access divide**
(possibilities of people have to access digital resources), **use divide** (lack
of digital skills), and quality of use gap.
