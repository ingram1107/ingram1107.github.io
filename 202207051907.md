# Switch

Switch is a #[Network Device](202207051821.md) that can operates in either
[Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)# or [Network Layer](202206131702.md)# (modern
implementation). It is an intelligence [Bridge](202207051851.md), which provide
*superior throughput performance*, *more ports* (lower per-port cost),
*high-speed connections*, segmentation using [Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)#
or [Broadcast Domain](202207061732.md)# (modern), and even routing (in the case
of **Multilayer Switch**). This makes large-scale segmentation possible within
the [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554).

It has three primary frame switching modes: [Cut-Through Switching](202207061210.md)#,
[Store-And-Forward Switching](202207061155.md)# and [Fragment-Free Switching](202207061215.md)#.
All of them will check the destination and source
[Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md), then check against *the
table*, which contains entries that map Switch port to a particular MAC,
maintained by Switch. It will place an entry for the source MAC corresponds to
the switch port where the frame came (if it hasn't done so before), and check
whether there is an entry for the destination MAC. If there is not, it will
flood (send frames to all other ports) the frames, and waits for the response.
If there is such a response coming from one of the switch's port, it will map
that port to the destination MAC and immediately forward the packet to the port.
Otherwise, depending on whether the destination MAC is in the same network
segment, it either doesn't forward the packet or forward the packet to the port
specified in the table (filtering).

Typical Switch's interfaces can't be assigned with #[IP Address](202206281021.md),
therefore it is usually without an IP address.

Switch provides means to resolve [Network Congestion](202209302043.md)#, e.g.
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)#

However, there are some limitation for the switch, especially in coming to solve
the #[Network Loop](202207081644.md).

There are several types of Switch:
- [Fixed Configuration Switch](202212062302.md)#
- [Modular Switch](202212062303.md)#
- [Stackable Switch](202212062305.md)#
