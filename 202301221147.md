# Packet-Filtering Routers

Packet-Filtering Routers is a type of #[Firewall](202210022249.md) that applies
a set of rules to each incoming or outgoing IP packet to either **forwards** or
**discards** it.

It is rather simple, transparent to the users, and high speed. However, setting
up such packet filter rules could be a daunting task. And there is a lack of
[Authentication](202210022151.md). The attacker could spoof their IP address
(forges a source [IP Address](202206281021.md)), initiate a source routing
attack (partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the
network) and tiny fragment attack.
