# Frame Relay

Frame Relay is a #[packet-switched](202207150848.md)
[Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) service that operate at the
[Physical Layer](202206131647.md)# (EIA/TIA-232 specification is the standard) and
[Data Link Layer](202206131651.md)#. Its speed usually ranges from 56 kbps to
2Mbps, and it provides connection-oriented services using virtual circuits.
Recently, it's been viewed as obsolete because of the wide adoption of
[Dense Leased Line (DLL)](202207150843.md).

[Virtual circuit](202208301234.md)# is basically a logical connection between two
**data terminal equipment (DTE)** devices, such as terminals, PCs, routers and
bridges, across a Frame Relay packet-switched network which can be uniquely
identified by data-link connection identifier (DLCI) at the *network endpoints*.
Since it is logical, within a single physical circuit there can exist multiple
virtual circuits. Within this virtual circuit, there could be multiple **data
communications equipments (DCE)**, usually a [Switch](202207051907.md)#, which
provides clocking and switching services in a network.

Frame Relay protocol will utilise the DLCI to map the packet to the service
provider's switch's outbound ports by referring to the lookup table stored. The
path to the destination is determined *before the frame is sent*. *Local
Management Interface (LMI)* is used to manage a connection between a router and
a Frame Relay switch, where it tracks and manage keep-alive mechanisms multicast
messages and status.

To deal with [network congestion](202209302043.md)#, Frame Relay switching
equipment can mark a Frame Relay packet with *forward explicit congestion
notification (FECN)* or *backward explicit congestion notification (ECN)*. The
former will be sent to the *destination device* whereas the latter will be sent
to the *source router*. The respective DTE equipment will notify higher layer
about the congestion based on such mark, and decide whether act accordingly or
ignore such messages. Other than FECN and BECN, the packet could be marked as
*discard eligible (DE)*, which enable the switching equipment to drop it
whenever there is a congestion.

A basic frame relay frame format have four kinds of field including two flag
fields at each end (indicate the beginning and the end of the frame), address
field, information field, and frame check sequence (FCS) field. An address filed
consists of data link connection identified bits (DLCI, can be used to store the
[top MPLS label](202207150852.md)), address field extension bits (EA), command
or response bit (C/R), FECN, BECN, and discard eligibility bit (DE).
