# P2P File Sharing with Distributed Peers

The peers form an abstract, logical network called an *overlay network* in which
every [TCP](202206151232.md) connection between two peers is represented with an
edge. When a peer is trying to join into the network, it first must have the
list of peers that are often up in the network or obtain it from authorised
site. Next, the peer tries to establish a TCP connection with one of the peers
in the obtained list, and sends a Ping message, which includes a peer-count
field, to the peer connected. The peer then forwards it to all its neighbours in
the network, and the neighbours forwards the message until the peer-count reach
0. When the peer receives the Ping message, it responds with Pong message
across the network to the initial peer, in which it includes the peer's
[IP Address](202206281021.md), number of files it is sharing, etc. Now, the
initial peer knows the IP addresses of many peers in the network, and be able to
set up TCP connections with some peers. Gnutella protocol uses this approach.

Despite its simplicity, this approach of [Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing](202303081138.md)
can generate a lot of traffic into the Internet due to its query flooding, thus
limits its scalability. One of the solution is to limit the scope of the query
flooding.
