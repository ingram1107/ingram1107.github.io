# Commonly Used Set

The following are the commonly used #[202204281446](202204281446.md):

Symbols | Meaning
---|---
$\mathbb{R}$ | The set of all real numbers
$\mathbb{Z}$ | The set of all integers
$\mathbb{Q}$ | The set of all rational numbers
$\mathbb{N}$ | The set of all natural numbers

Sometimes, these symbols could have a superscript such as $+$, $-$ and
$\textit{nonneg}$. They indicate a set that has only positive, negative or
non-negative elements respectively. For example, $\mathbb{Z}^-$ means the set of
all negative integers.

**Note**: $0$ is neither *positive* nor *negative* number.
