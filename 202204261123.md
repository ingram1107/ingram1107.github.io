# Git Merge

`merge {target}` incorporates branches by first creating a new commit in the
current branch, and then *link* the target branch's, or to be merged branch's,
HEAD to the new commit. This results in a web history where the merged branch
preserve its origin of divergent and a commit of having two parent commits in
the current branch.

**Note**: When using `^` symbol with commits, be aware whether the commit has
multiple parents. See [202205251604](202205251604.md)#.

It is useful for feature development and bug fixes especially if these are split
from a branch. It is similar to [202204261122](202204261122.md) but the latter focus on having
a linear commit history instead of preserving split and merge points.
