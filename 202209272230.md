# Terraform Lifecycle

Within the #[resource block](202206072140.md), we could define a lifecycle block
to have fine control over how to manage the resource which could be useful in
[Immutable Infrastructure](202209271906.md)# implementation. There are three
options available: `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy` and
`ignore_changes`.

Setting `create_before_destroy` to true like the following will command the
resource to be created before destroyed, unlike the default behaviour where the
resource will be destroyed first before created.

```hcl
resource ... {
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

To disallow destroying the resource altogether when running `terraform destroy`,
set `prevent_destroy` to true like below. That being said, the resource will
still be destroyed if the command `terraform destroy` was run.

```hcl
resource ... {
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

If we don't want the changes result in altering the state of resource, that is
whether it should be created or destroyed, we could tell
#[Terraform](202205041220.md) to ignore changes according to *a list*. We could
define which variable should be ignored inside a list and then pass it to the
option `ignore_changes`. If all changes should be ignored in the resource, then
we could use the special keyword `all` and assigned it to the option.

```hcl
resource ... {
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```
