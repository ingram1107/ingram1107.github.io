# Synchronous Transport Signal (STS)

STS is a group of standards that specify the details of high-speed connections.
The following table shows the data rates of digital circuits correspond to each
STS standard and [OC](202404102238.md) standard:

| [Copper](202210111820.md) Name | [Optic](202209021233.md) Name | Bit Rate       | Voice Circuits |
| ---                            | ---                           | ---            | ---            |
| STS-1                          | OC-1                          | 51.840 Mbps    | 810            |
| STS-3                          | OC-3                          | 155.520 Mbps   | 2,430          |
| STS-12                         | OC-12                         | 622.080 Mbps   | 9,720          |
| STS-24                         | OC-24                         | 1,244.160 Mbps | 19,440         |
| STS-48                         | OC-48                         | 2,488.320 Mbps | 38,880         |
| STS-192                        | OC-192                        | 9,953.280 Mbps | 155,520        |

**Note**: STS refers to electrical signals used in digital circuit interface
whereas OC refers to optical signals that propagate across the
[fibre](202209021233.md).
