# 802.1x/EAP-FAST

802.1x/EAP-FAST is an [Authentication](202210221150.md) service for wireless
network access with [Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)](202303082101.md)
and Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunnel (FAST).

Upon request from the client for wireless network access, the network access
point (NAP) will send an EAP-Identity-Request packet to the client, which the
client in turn responses with the packet EAP-Identity-Response. After the
client's identity is verified, the NAP forwards the EAP-Request EAP Type request
from the AAA server and waits for EAP-Response for EAP Type. If the process is a
success, the NAP will forward EAP-Success packet to the client along with a
**pairwise master key (PMK)** and the network connection is established.
