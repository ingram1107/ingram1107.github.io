# Virtual Network Infrastructure

A virtual network infrastructure involves partitioning network resources into
isolated environment. It includes three components: [Access Control](202210022203.md),
*path isolation*, and *services edge*.

Access control authenticates and authorises network access requests from clients
into appropriate network partition. This can be done with
[802.1x](202303082056.md) Identity-Based Networking Services (IBNS). Some
devices such as ATMs, IP video surveillance cameras, manufacturing robots can
use MAC Auth Bypass (MAB) and static port assignment for proper access control.

Path isolation securely isolates traffic within assigned network partitions
across the infrastructure. [Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md) provides the
first layer of path isolation, alongside with other technolgies GRE, [IEEE 802.1Q](202212251358.md),
VRF-Lite, and [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md) for secure
network partitions. For WAN and MAN, GRE, MPLS VPN, and DMVPN provides the
secure network partitions.

Services edge maps network partitions to the appropriate services that each
partition has access to, based on a set of policies.
