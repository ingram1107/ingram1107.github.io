# MAC Flooding

MAC flooding is done by flooding the address tables on a
[Switch](202207051907.md) with bogus [MAC addresses](202206151451.md) to make
the switch to fail. Thus, this makes the [Intruder](202301021642.md) able to
exploit the sniffing or snooping state of the switch. The attack can be
prevented by limit the number of MAC addresses per port.
