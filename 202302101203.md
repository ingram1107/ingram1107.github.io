# Data Abstraction in DBMS

One can deploy data abstraction in a [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md)
with the use of [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](202207041054.md) to form layers of
abstraction to prevent users from overwhelm by the details. In database
management world, we describe the abstraction with *three levels*:
1. **Physical Level** is the lowest level of abstraction describes *how* the
   data are stored. It is equivalent to Model.
2. **Logical Level** describes **what** data are stored, and what relationships
   they participate with other data. It is equivalent to View.
3. **View Level** describes limited part of a database system. In which
   information should be included is a matter of use cases. It is equivalent to
   Controller.

**Note**: An DBMS could be said to be **physical data independence** if the user
of the logical level doesn't need to be aware of the underlying physical
complexity.
