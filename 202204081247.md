# Systemd

## Drop-in Files

We could configure a service by using drop-in files in
`/etc/systemd/system/{service}.service.d/`.

## Cgroups

To view [202204071051](202204071051.md)# related information, use commands `systemd-cgls` to
show cgroups in tree hierarchy and `systemd-cgtop` to show their current
resource usage. Most of such information are stored in the `system.slice`
directory.

Except `Slice` option (to create a custom cgroup), all property related to
cgroups could be defined and altered by the command `systemctl set-property
{Option}`.
