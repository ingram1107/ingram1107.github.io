# GDB

GDB has some useful debugging features that could speed up your workflow or give
more thorough debugging information.

## Conditional Breaks

We could set a conditional breakpoint using the syntax below:

```gdb
break myfile.c:20 if (var == 30)
```

GDB will stop there if the variable `var` in the scope is equals to 30 when it
reached the line number 20 in the file `myfile.c`

This will accelerate our debugging speed and filter other unwanted states as
much as possible.

## Backtrace Verboseness

We could adjust how verbose the information that the command `backtrace` should
show by setting the value to two variables: `frame-arguments` and `frame-info`.
