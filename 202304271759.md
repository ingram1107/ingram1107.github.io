# Coexistence Between Bluetooth and Wi-Fi

Since some [Wi-Fi](202303292155.md) uses 2.4 GHz or similar band for
#communication, it might be in the way of Bluetooth and disrupt the local
networking. For them to coexist in the same environment, there are collaborative
and non-collaborative solutions.

With collaborative solution, it utilises technologies such as deterministic
frequency nulling and [Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA)](202303301637.md).
The basic idea is to exchange information among Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices.
This is best when both [Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)](202303292149.md)
and [Wireless LAN (WLAN)](202302161710.md) interface devices are embedded in the
same piece of equipment.

With non-collaborative solution, it utilises technologies like adaptive
frequency hopping and power control. No collaboration is needed in this
solution.
