# Subset

When all the elements of a #[202204281446](202204281446.md) $S$ is also an element in another
set $P$, we could say that $S$ is a subset of $P$ which is denoted as $S
\subseteq P$. From this property, we know that $P$ is also a subset of itself,
thus $P \subseteq P$.

If at least one element of $P$ is not in the subset $S$, then $S$ is a proper
subset of $P$, denoted as $S \subset P$.
