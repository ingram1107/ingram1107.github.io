such as [encryption](202209281121.md), [format conversion](202205202129.md), and
#compression. The data format usually converted to **abstract syntax notation 1
(ANS.1)** defined in ISO 8824. Services and protocols in this layer are defined
in ISO 8822 and 8823 respectively. [Session Layer](202206131849.md),
[Application Layer](202206131856.md) and itself are commonly known as
