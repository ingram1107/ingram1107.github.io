# Mach Network Message Server (NetMsgServer)

NetMsgServer performs transparent naming and transport for #[202204222158](202204222158.md) to
communicate with remote devices at user level. It is protocol-independent and
capable of using various network protocols.

In order to establish communication between computers within a network,
NetMsgServer provides a primitive network-wide name service. Its responsibility
is to register ports, requested by local tasks, for lookup by tasks from other
computer. NetMsgServers also maintain a distributed database of port rights that
have been transferred between devices and of port to which these rights pointed
to. These ports could be removed from and/or added to the database as long as
the port value of them are matched.

The sender's NetMsgServer creates proxy port, if it has received a send right
from a remote computer, to represent the original port from that computer.
Therefore, Mach could treat it like any local port where the sender can send
messages to this proxy port without hassle. The receiver's NetMsgServer then
translate the [message](202204231432.md)# from the sender's format to the
receiver's format by referring to the type information stored in it.
