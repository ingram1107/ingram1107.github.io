**Note**: Symmetric Cryptography is in the unit key size in bit, ECC-based
scheme is in size of $n$ in bits, and RSA/DSA is in modulus size in bits.

As we can see from the above table, for [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md)#
to achieve the same security level as Symmetric Cryptography, it needs larger
bits or key sizes. However, without stating the key sizes, it is rather hard to
compare the security between two schemes.
