WASS provides a suit of funtionalities that allows high-speed access of remote
application servers reside in a centralised [Data Centre](202210012205.md). This
includes *[protocol optimisations](202302131744.md)*,
*[traffic compression](202302131803.md)*, and information #caching. In addition, it provides
[Wide Area File Services (WAFS)](202302131722.md) as well. It is done by two
entities: Core Wide Area Engine (WAE) on the data centre which provides

application-to-server performance, for communication.
