# Wireframe

Wireframe is a blueprint for UX designers to [layout](202304302220.md) content
and functionality on a page taking account from [user needs](202303251328.md)
and [user journeys](202303242126.md). It is to establish a basic structure of a
page before any visual #design and content is added. Wireframe serves as a draft
or guideline to ensure that the designers are heading in the right direction
before fully committed to a [prototype](202207120959.md).
