# Tasks or Threads Synchronisation

Synchronisation can be done between tasks and/or threads by determining on
shared resource availability (**resource synchronisation**) or execution state
(**activity synchronisation**/condition synchronisation/sequence control).

A na√Øve attempt on implementing tasks or threads synchronisation can be done via
global variables, however it is simply not the recommended way to do it. The
reason is that global variables are prone to possible data corruption due to
inopportune pre-emption. Instead, we should use the following data structure to
synchronise the tasks or threads:
- [Mutex in Pthread](202112061117.md)
- [Mutex in Rust](202207172109.md)
- [Barrier in Pthread](202112262322.md)
- [Semaphore](202404302127.md)
- [Mailbox](202405040951.md)


- [Rendezvous Synchronisation](202407151452.md)
