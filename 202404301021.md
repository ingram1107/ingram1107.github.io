# Tasks or Threads Synchronisation

A na√Øve attempt on implementing tasks or threads synchronisation can be done via
global variables, however it is simply not the recommended way to do it. The
reason is that global variables are prone to possible data corruption due to
inopportune pre-emption. Instead, we should use the following data structure to
synchronise the tasks or threads:
- [Mutex in Pthread](202112061117.md)
- [Mutex in Rust](202207172109.md)
- [Barrier in Pthread](202112262322.md)
- [Semaphore](202404302127.md)
- [Mailbox](202405040951.md)
