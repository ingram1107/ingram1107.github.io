# AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Like explained in [AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)](202401161735.md), one
can simply deploy their own container strategies incorporating [Container Orchestration](202203291434.md)
tool of [Kubernetes](202201291535.md) on their [EC2](202401152149.md) instances.
However, AWS provides EKS to simplify such deployment process which
automatically manages the scalability and availability of the cluster nodes. It
also automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes for each
cluster.
