# Shannon's Limit

For *infinite bandwidth*, the ratio $\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ (from
#[Channel Capacity Theorem](202210290901.md)) approaches the limiting value
which is called the Shannon's Limit for an AWGN Channel:

$$
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_\infty = \lim_{B \rightarrow \infty} \left(
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)
$$
