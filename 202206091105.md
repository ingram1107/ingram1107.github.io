# Maximum Flow Problem

Maximum Flow Problem ask: With an infinite input source (denoted $s$), how much
flow can we push to through the network (depicted as [202206091453](202206091453.md)#), that is to the
end node (sometime call sink, denoted $t$), given that each edge has a certain
capacity (that one should not exceed)? [^williamfiset2018]

The problem can be solved various #algorithm :
- [202206091518](202206091518.md)# (resulted in $O(fE)$)
- Edmonds-Karp (utilises BFS, resulted in $O(E^2 V)$)
- capacity scaling (pick larger paths first, resulted in $O(E^2 \log{V})$)
- Dinic's algorithm (combination of BFS and #[202205021959](202205021959.md) resulted in $O(V^2
  E)$)
- push-relabel (maintain preflow instead of calculating augmented path, resulted
  in $O(V^2 E)$ or $O(V^2 \sqrt{E})$)

It is a useful model or simulation for digestion problem such as routing,
