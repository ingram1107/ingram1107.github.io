# Mughal Sultanate

The founder of the Mughal Sultanate, Babur, also founded Shurat-I-Am (Jabatan
Kerja Raya) which was responsible for building colleges and schools. His
successor Humayun and Akbar built madrasa in Delhi and colleges in Fatehpur
Sikri and Agra respectively. Jahangir, son of Akbar, converted rich's estate to
sponsor scholarship.

During the reign of Akbar, several indigenous Indian artists had already
outnumbered those of Persian influence. The Mughal Art Institute was established
in order to mix the art style of Indian and Persian. This is illustrated by the
wall arts in Fatehpur Sikri. Well known Indian painters are Basavan, Lal,
Daswanth. Buildings such as Kabuli Bagh Mosque in Punipat and Jama Mosque in
Delhi were greatly influence by this Mughal art influence. However, there is
also Taj Mahal built by Shah Jahan that consists of only Islamic style.
