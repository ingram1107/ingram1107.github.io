# NetBIOS Session Service

[NetBIOS](202303141007.md) session service provides connection-oriented,
reliable, and full-duplex message service like [TCP](202206151232.md) but with
no supporting of out-of-bound message. Local [name](202303141012.md)
([Well-Known Ports](202206151841.md)) and remote name are needed to establish a
session, which will be a parameter for sending and receiving message to and from
a program.
