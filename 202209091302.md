# Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)

TDM is one of the implementation of #[Multiplexing](202209091259.md) where each
end station own a particular *time slot* for the network transmission in a link.
This means that each data stream has an assigned slot in a repeating sequence
which is more efficient compare to assigning a physical connection to each of
them. In the context of optical transmission, this means that several signals
are travelling in a single wavelength but is divided into several channels using
time slot.

However, this is not without any downside: since the end station own the time
slot, other end station could not utilise it for their own advantages when the
time slot is in idle which is wasted.

The transmission rate of a TDM link can be calculated using the following
formula:

$$
\text{transmission rate of circuit } = \text{ frame rate } \times \text{number
of bits in a slot}
$$

There are several technologies implement the multiplexing scheme or anything
similar to this:
- [Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)](202209021758.md)#
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)
