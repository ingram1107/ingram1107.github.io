# Closure of Functional Dependencies

A closure of [Functional Dependencies](202308291830.md) $F$, denotes as $F^+$,
is a set of all functional dependencies logically implied by $F$. To be
logically implied, every instance of relational schema $r(R)$ that satisfies $F$
must also satisfy $f$. We can determine whether the attrivute is in the closure
using **Armstrong's axiom**:
- **reflexivity rule**: if $\alpha$ is a set of attributes and the attribute $B
  \subseteq \alpha$, then $\alpha \rightarrow B$
- **augmentation rule**: if $\alpha \rightarrow B$ holds and $\gamma$ is a set
  of attributes, then $\alpha \rightarrow \gamma\beta$ holds
- **transitivity rule**: if $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ holds and $\beta
  \rightarrow \gamma$ holds, then $\alpha \rightarrow \gamma$
