# Python Object Initialisation

We can initialise an existing class object by using the dunder method
`__init__`. However, with this method, we can't alter immutable object such as
tuple in the class object since it is already created before we could initialise
it. The alternative for it is to use another dunder method,
#[__new__](202206081916.md).
