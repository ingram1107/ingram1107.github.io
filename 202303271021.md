# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract factory pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that defines an
interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specialising their concrete classes. It involves **abstract factory**,
**concrete factory**, **abstract product**, and **concrete product**. Like in
[Factory Method Pattern](202302232101.md), the creation of the product objects
are delegated to the subclasses, with the difference of each subclass may
correspond to different platform-specific product creation. Alternative to this
method of product creation is with [Prototype Pattern](202304081512.md). Often
time, an instance of the concrete factory is created as a
[Singleton](202211231900.md) at run-time.

The Gang of Four recommended to use abstract factory pattern when:
1. The system should be independent of product creation, composition, and
   representation.
2. The system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
3. A family of related product objects is designed to be used together.
4. It should reveal only the interfaces of a class library of products.

Using this pattern can isolate clients from implementation classes as the
factory encapsulates the responsibility and process of creating product objects.
Since most concrete factories are based on singleton, a whole product family can
be changed at once without much hassle as the abstract family can create
complete family in one go. Furthermore, it promotes consistency among products.
It is with limitation such that adding new kind of product can be a pain as the
abstract factory fixes the set of products that can be created for product
creation, though this can be solved by parameterising with the trade-off of
being type unsafe.
