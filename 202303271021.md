# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract factory pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that defines an
interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specialising their concrete classes. It involves **abstract factory**,
**concrete factory**, **abstract product**, and **concrete product**. Like in
[Factory Method Pattern](202302232101.md), the creation of the product objects
are delegated to the subclasses, with the difference of each subclass may
correspond to different platform-specific product creation. Often time, an
instance of the concrete factory is created at run-time.

The Gang of Four recommended to use abstract factory pattern when:
1. The system should be independent of product creation, composition, and
   representation.
2. The system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
3. A family of related product objects is designed to be used together.
4. It should reveal only the interfaces of a class library of products.
