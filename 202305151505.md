# Design Rule

Design rule suggests how to increase the [Product Usability](202303242139.md).
Based on the nature of a design rule, it differs in generality (applicability in
more or less design circumstances) and authority. Thus, design rule can be
categorised into [Design Principles](202304081741.md) (abstract and high
generality but low authority), [Design Guideline](202305151516.md) (have more
general application but doesn't have high authority) and [Design Standard](202305151526.md)
(high authority but have limited applicability).
