# Randomness

The things that we call random are not entirely "random". For example, we often
think that flipping a coin and guess which face will be up should be a random
result. However, we know there are several factors that could influence the
result from a flipped coin: the force applied, the strength of the wind, air
resistance etc. If we can obtain the accurate value about these data, we can
predict which face will be up once the coin have been flipped.

From here we know that randomness, is **the ignorance of the initial
condition(s) of a chaotic system**. Randomness can be predicted and known in
advance. For instance, there are many programming languages implemented their
own random generator (pseudorandom number generator, PRNG). If we can know
what's the formulae that's behind the function generating random numbers, we can
predict what random numbers will be generated in sequence. Therefore, attempting
to encrypt a data with random number generated by the computer which mostly
operated in a deterministic manner is a #cryptography and #security disaster.

There are many use cases in [Cryptography](202209281121.md)# relies on random
numbers such as [Nonce](202210211901.md)# in authentication protocols, session
keys, [public key generation](202203221212.md), and keystream for [One-Time Pad](202209281248.md).
