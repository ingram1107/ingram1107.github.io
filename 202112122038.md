# Hash Function

Hash Function, denoted as $h = H(M)$, is an unkey public function that condenses
arbitrary lengths of value into a fixed size output (fingerprint). It could be
used as a mapping function of #[Hash Table](202112122035.md) key into an
appropriate cell, in #[Digital Signature](202210040909.md) for
[authentication](202210022151.md)#, creating one-way password, detecting
intrusion or virus, or construct [pseudorandom](202207162147.md)# function (PRF)
or a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG).

It could be attacked by [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md) by inspecting the
bit length of the hash value (match until collision happen) or
[Cryptanalysis](202209281128.md) based on the cryptographic weakness on the
algorithm. Hash Function is susceptible to [Birthday Attack](202302041708.md).

## Attention

- Hash Function should be easy to compute
- Needs to handle [Hash Collision](202112131158.md)#
- There are three practical requirements for Hash Function
  - variable input size (can be applied to a block of data of any size)
  - fixed output/fingerprint size
  - efficiency
- There are four security requirements for Hash Function
  - preimage resistant/one-way property (given $h$, [computationally infeasible](202209281245.md)#
    to find $y$ (preimage) such that $H(y) = h$)
  - second preimage resistant/weak collision resistant (given $x$ (first
    preimage), [computationally infeasible](202209281245.md)# to find $y \not =
    x$ (second preimage) such that $H(x) = H(y)$)
  - collision resistant/strong collision resistant ([computationally infeasible](202209281245.md)#
    to find any pair $(x, y)$ such that $H(x) = H(y)$)
  - [pseudorandomness](202207162147.md)#

**Note**: Weak collision resistance is a stronger security guarantee than Strong
collision resistance.

## Implementation

Depends on the data type, hash function could be different.

Although [Block Cipher](202209281239.md) implementation could be used,
especially with [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)](202210071133.md) (without key),
the resulting hash could be too small. It could be broke using [Birthday Attack/Paradox](202302041708.md)
and [Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM)](202210061036.md). In this implementation, the
final block will be used as a hash value. SHA-1 is the example for it. The
following equation shows such implementation's structure:

$$
\begin{align}
CV_0 &= iv\\
CV_1 &= f(CV_{i-1}, Y_{i-1}), 1 \le i \le L\\
H(M) &= CV_L
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $CV$ is the chaining value
- $iv$ is the initialisation value
- $Y_i$ is the $i$-th input block
- $f$ is the compression algorithm

### Integer

Simply return `Key` mod `TableSize`.

### String

Use [Horner's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method):

```c
Index Hash(const char *Key, int TableSize) {
  unsigned int HashVal = 0;

  while(*Key != '\0')
    HashVal = (HashVal << 5) + *Key++;

  return HashVal % TableSize;
}
```

Even though this will not result in the best table distribution, this algorithm
is simple and fast if overflow is allowed. However, if the key is very long, it
could take a long time to compute the key. One could compute for just a **few
characters** to improve the performance.
