# Hash Function

Hash Function is a mapping of #[202112122035](202112122035.md) key into the appropriate cell.

## Attention

- Hash Function should be easy to compute
- Need to handle [202112131158](202112131158.md)#

## Implementation

Depends on the data type, hash function could be different.

### Integer

Simply return `Key` mod `TableSize`.

### String

Use [Horner's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method):

```c
Index Hash(const char *Key, int TableSize) {
  unsigned int HashVal = 0;

  while(*Key != '\0')
    HashVal = (HashVal << 5) + *Key++;

  return HashVal % TableSize;
}
```

Even though this will not result in the best table distribution, this algorithm
is simple and fast if overflow is allowed. However, if the key is very long, it
could take a long time to compute the key. One could compute for just a **few
characters** to improve the performance.
