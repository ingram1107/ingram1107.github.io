symmetric downstream and upstream speed of 14.4 Kbps. It is usually displayed as
2G in [mobile connection](202303292147.md).

GSM signalling protocol provides radio #resource management (controls set-up,
termination, and [hand-offs](202305111947.md) of radio channels), mobility
management (location and security using [MTSO](202305111959.md)), connection
