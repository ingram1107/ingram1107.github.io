# Fixed-Size Memory Management

In fixed-size memory management, available memory space is divided into
variously sized memory pools, implemented as a [Linked List](202110191729.md)
with a control structure as their head, with all blocks within them having the
same size. Each memory-pool control structure maintains information including
block size, total number of blocks, number of free blocks etc. The allocation
and deallocation happens at the beginning of the list. Note that the smallest
possible size that is adequate for an allocation is prioritised first.

This memory management approach reduces [Internal Fragmentation](202407021029.md)
and provides high memory utilisation for [Process](202210062301.md) that
operates in predictable and static environment. It is more deterministic compare
to [Memory Compaction](202407021032.md) as it doesn't require memory
restructuring. That being said, it is impossible to anticipate the memory block
sizes for process that operates in dynamic environments and the number of blocks
to be allocated for each size. The latter will result in under utilised or over
utilised memory pool.
