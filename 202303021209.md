# Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP)

SPP is a connection-oriented, reliable, full-duplex protocol in
[Xeros Network Systems (XNS)](202303021149.md) operates in [Transport Layer](202206131837.md).
It views data in a hierarchy: bytes as the basic unit, where packet is composed
of 0 or more bytes, and message is composed of one or more bytes. It provides
three interfaces: *byte-stream* (like in [TCP](202206151232.md), byte delivered
in order) with optional message boundaries but no packet boundaries,
*packet-stream* (packets delivered in order), and *reliable-packet* which
doesn't provide message boundaries and might be out of order.
