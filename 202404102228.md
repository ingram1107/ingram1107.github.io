# Digital Signal Level Standard (DS)

DS standard is used to [multiplex](202209091259.md) multiple phone calls onto
single connection. For example, DS1 can multiplex 24 phone calls. Note that
digital circuit [leased](202207150843.md) from [TelCo](202209271141.md) still
follows the digital transmission standards of digital phone calls. It may lease
circuits with lower capacity, which is known as fractional T1 circuits.
