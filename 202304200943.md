# Attribute

Attribute is a function that maps from an [Entity Set](202304191956.md) into a
[domain](202304200952.md). There are several types of attribute depends on their
properties: *simple attribute* that can't be divided into subparts, *composite
attribute* that can be divided into subparts, *single-valued attribute* that
only have one value for an [Entity](202304191954.md), *multivalued attribute*
that has set of values for an [Entity](202304191954.md), and *derived attribute*
where its value can be computed from other attributes or entities. A multivalued
attribute can be denoted as $\{ \text{multivalued attribute name} \}$.

**Note**: When there is a need from the user to search only a part of the
component from an attribute, a composite attribute is the best choice to fit the
[Requirement](202303251303.md).

When there is a null value in an attribute, it usually represents
non-applicability, or it is missing or not known.
