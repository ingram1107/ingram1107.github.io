# Port-Mapped I/O

Port-mapped I/O or isolated I/O uses separate address space from main memory.
This can be implemented by an extra I/O pin on the CPU or a dedicated bus to
I/O. It has a dedicated set of [Microprocessor](202404051142.md) instructions.
The device address is specified using a port number, each device with a
different one, in the instruction. Port-mapped I/O has limited capability as it
has only simple load-and-store operations between CPU registers and I/O ports.
