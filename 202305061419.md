# DECIDE Framework

DECIDE framework is a framework to guide [UI/UX Evaluation](202305061338.md).
It is an acronym of **Determine**, **Explore**, **Choose**, **Identify**,
**Decide**, and **Evaluate**.

## Determine the goals

Goal is important as it guides the evaluation by helping it to determine its
scope and influencing the approach to be used. Examples of goals are
*identify the best [Interface Metaphor](202304161003.md) on which to base the
design*, *check to ensure that the final interface is consistent*, *investigate
how technology affects working aspects* etc.

## Explore the questions

Questions, derived from goal, could be used to guide the evaluation as well.
Sub-questions that broken down from the questions can make the evaluation more
fine-grained.

## Choose the evaluation approach and methods

Choose a compatible [UI/UX Evaluation](202305061338.md) approach(s) and
method(s). If different perspectives should be obtained, we can combine
different evaluation approaches and methods.

## Identify the practical issues

Examples:
- select users
- stay on budget
- stay on schedule
- find evaluators
- select equipment

## Decide how to deal with the ethical issues

If the activities involve human being, we should develop an informed consent
form for the participants to sign. They have the right to know the goals of the
study, what should be expected to be happened to the findings, privacy of personal
information, leave when they wish, and have dignity.

## Evaluate, analyse, interpret, and present the data

The evaluation approaches and methods used will influence how the data is
evaluated, interpreted, and presented. We have to consider the product's
reliability or replicability, validity (is it measuring what we want it to
measure), biases, scope (able to generalise), and ecological validity or
influence from environment factors.
