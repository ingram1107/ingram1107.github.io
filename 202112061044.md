# Difference between thread and processes

Threads share the same environment between each other. They share the same value
of PID, variables and even the memory space.

In conjunction, even though [Process](202210062301.md)# could create its own
child processes, those processes don't necessarily share the same variable
and PID. Furthermore, child processes will not be allocated to its parent's
memory space. They [sometime](202202142236.md) will even occupy a separate
system resources for themselves.
