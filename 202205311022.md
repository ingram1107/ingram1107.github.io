# Application Binary Interface (ABI)

ABI is an interface between two binary program modules, usually one of them is
the library and one of them is the user program. It is the assumptions the
compiler makes about how exactly the *bit-for-bit representation* and the usage
of computer's actual *hardware resources* when it negotiates things that lie
outside a *singular routine*. This includes:

- the position, order, and layout of memory in `struct` or `class`
- the argument types and return types of a function (for C++, apply to any
  relevant overloaded functions too)
- the special method in `class` (C++ only)
- hierarchy and ordering of virtual function (C++ only)

Every platform has their own ABI standard, and different compiler or vendor may
have different ABI implementation.

Since C doesn't mangle the assembly symbols (change the function name in
assembly code), this causes a lot of troubles in the ABI. If there are two
libraries or implementation files have the same function name with the same
number of arguments but having different return types or argument types, there
is no guarantee on which function should be linked by the linker. The following
examples show how could such incident happen:

```c
// do_stuff.c
__int128_t do_stuff(__int128_t value) {
  if (value < 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  return value;
}
```

```c
// main.c
#include <limits.h>

extern long long do_stuff(long long value); // the compiler will not warn this

int main() {
  long long x = do_stuff(-LLONG_MAX); // memory violation as the ABI uses the 128-bit version
  /* wow cool stuff with x ! */
  if (x != 0)
    return 1;
  return 0;
}
```

This is the reason a lot of features in C and C++ are introduced with the prefix
`_` or `__` which is particularly declared by the committee as reserved
identifiers. In the book Modern C, the author recommends using the library name
as the prefix of functions and variables, e.g., in [Pthread](202112061056.md)
case. It is to avoid ABI violation that could not be detected by the compilers
and linkers, each has their own implementation on how to handle the standard.

An old solution used by compilers is by giving the programmer the control over
what should the function be named in the assembly code, i.e., changing the
function's assembly label (sometime called binary symbol).

Another solution proposed by Meneide [^meneide2022] is to introduce transparent
alias with the keyword `_Alias` [^n2970]. Programmers can change what should the
function to be named in the source code level without changing the underlying
assembly label for that function. That being said, this could increase the
binary size of the program due to the duplication of the functions.

The shortcomings of these solutions, however, is that they don't allow the
linkage against the old version of library if the program is build with newer
version of it. This is because the old version of library doesn't have the
symbols that the newer version of it. We can say that the library doesn't have
*forward compatibility*.
