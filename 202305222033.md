# Synchronous CMC

Synchronous CMC is a [Computed Mediated Communication (CMC)](202305222032.md)
where conversation happen in real time through text or voice. It is suitable for
shy people, updating on organisational events without physically present, and
quick Q&A. However, it provides no eye contact for the utterances and might
encourage hypocrites. Poor quality of images may happen too.
