# Java Platform, Micro-Edition (Java ME)

Java ME is a [Mobile Runtime Environment](202407241929.md) that provides a
subset of the functionality offered by Java Standard Edition (Java SE) and Java
Enterprise Edition (Java EE) which is optimised for devices with limited
computing resources. It consists of three layers, which are Java [Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md),
configuration ([Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC)](202407242227.md),
[Connected Device Configuration (CDC)](202407242228.md)), and profile (personal,
Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP)). It can verify an application whether
it can run with Java ME Kilobyte Virtual Machine (KVM) at compile time.
