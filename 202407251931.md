# Peer-to-Peer Architecture

In peer-to-peer (p2p architecture), any participant can play whatever role that
it wants to be simultaneously unlike in [Client-Server Architecture](202304202049.md).
This means that a device can be at the same time a client and a server. This
kind of networking infrastructure is usually small, typically less than 10
nodes. See [Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing](202303081138.md).
