# Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS is the ability of a network to provide *improved service* to selected
network traffic over various underlying technologies. The increasing need for
real-time traffics such as video streaming and VoIP has made QoS as an important
requirement for a #[reliable](202210012123.md) network. It decreases the
[Network Congestion](202209302043.md)# and the effect on the quality of the
critical packets especially low delay and low jitter. QoS can potentially filter
out malicious low prioritised packets (from unknown type or origin) as a
policing mechanism, but it is still vulnerable to [DDoS](202209262115.md) and
concealed traffic.
