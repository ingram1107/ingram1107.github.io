# Quality of Service (QoS)

QoS is the ability of a network to provide *improved service* to selected
network traffic over various underlying technologies. It ranks different kind of
packets such as voice, [video](202302201418.md), e-mail, or other services and
assigned different priority on them so that high priority can pass through the
network first. The increasing need for real-time traffics such as video
streaming and [VoIP](202303201850.md) has made QoS as an important requirement
for a #[reliable](202210012123.md) network. It decreases the [Network Congestion](202209302043.md)#,
the effect on the quality of the critical packets especially low delay and low
[Jitter](202304092135.md) and minimises the packet loss. QoS can potentially
filter out malicious low prioritised packets (from unknown type or origin) as a
policing mechanism, but it is still vulnerable to [DDoS](202209262115.md) and
concealed traffic.

To achieve QoS, there are three steps to be considered: *provisioning*,
*classification*, and *scheduling*. In provisioning, the [Network Device](202207051821.md)
calculate the required bandwidth including future capacity and growth that is
available for all applications. The classification on the packet is done either
in [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md), [Network Layer](202206131702.md), or at
the endpoints. A typical ranking includes critical (voice and mission-critical
data), high (video), normal (e-mail, Internet access), and Low (fax, [FTP](202210221515.md)).
Then, the device schedules the packet and assigns them to the queues.

In low bandwidth links, tools such as [traffic shaping](202302201414.md) and
[Link Fragmentation and Interleaving (LFI)](202302201415.md) can come in handy
in ensuring QoS. For [Wireless LAN (WLAN)](202302161710.md), [Wireless Multimedia (WMM)](202303021628.md)
provides QoS for wireless network connection.
