# Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

DSS is a [Digital Signature](202210040909.md) scheme standard based on
[El Gamal](202212102116.md) and Schnorr schemes defined by FIPS 186. Don't
confuse with DSA as DSA is the algorithm. The standard uses SHA-1 as the
[Hash Function](202112122038.md) to create 320-bit signature with 512-1024-bit
security. Its security depends on the difficulty of computing [Discrete Logarithms (DLOG)](202210232232.md).

DSS keeps $(p, q, g)$ as public key values, where:
- $p$ is a large prime $2^L$ where $L$ is 512 to 1024 bits and is a multiple of
  64
- $q$ is a randomly chosen 160-bit prime factor of $p - 1$
- $g = h^{(p-1)/q} \mod p$ where $h < p - 1, h^{(p-1)/q} \mod p > 1$

The user then will randomly choose a private key $x$ in which $x < q$ and
computes the public key $y = g^x \mod p$ (like in [El Gamal Encryption](202212102116.md)).
Another random [one-time use](202209281248.md) key $k$ is generated in which $k
< q$. After that, a signature pair could be computed shown in the following
formulas, which will be sent as a pair $(r, s)$, known as the [Digital Signature](202210040909.md),
alongside with the message $M$:

$$
\begin{align}
r &= (g^k \mod p) \mod q\\
s &= k^{-1} (\text{SHA-1} (M) + x \cdot r) (\mod q)
\end{align}
$$

To verify such signature, the recipient needs to compute following the
procedures written below:

$$
\begin{align}
w &= s^{-1} \mod q\\
u_1 &= \text{SHA-1}(M) \cdot w \mod q\\
u_2 &= r \cdot w \mod q\\
v &= (g^{u_1} \cdot y^{u_2} \mod p) \mod q
\end{align}
$$

If the resulting $v$ is equal to $r$, then the signature can be said to be a
valid one.
