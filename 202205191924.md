# SSH Configuration

The default behaviour of #[202205191908](202205191908.md) can be changed in the file
`/etc/ssh/ssh_config` (system-wide) or `~/.ssh/config` (user specific).

To allow #[202205182136](202205182136.md) #[202203221227](202203221227.md) by default, set `ForwardX11` or
`ForwardX11Trusted` (less secure) to `yes` in the config file on the client side
and `X11Forwarding` to `yes` on the server side. This is corresponded to the
`-X` and `-Y` option.
