# Mainframe Architecture

Mainframe architecture is a [System Architecture](202303242154.md) where the
server performs all processing tasks and the clients (called dumb terminals) act
merely as an interface to the server with little processing power and storage
#resource. If an organisation is in need of large amounts of processing or high
#security requirement, mainframe architecture is a wise choice.

Comparing to [Client-Server Architecture](202304202049.md), it has a rigid
foundation on architectural structure. The development of application is usually
highly structured or organised but slow and with traditional methods. Users are
often limited to text interface (terminal) with constraining options. Once a
processing option, either [online](202304202000.md) or [batch](202304202003.md),
is decided, it is hard or impossible to modify later. However, this is not
without benefits, mainframe architecture provide a centralise and easier
security control over the information system since all the data and processing
are store or done in one place. Most of the time, organisation that adopts this
architecture is depended on a single proprietary vendor which has a very rigid
#hardware and/or #software [integration](202303242149.md).
