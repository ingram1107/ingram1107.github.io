# Requirement

Requirement is a statement (not in ambiguous natural language) that identity an
essential need of a [System](202303242148.md). It represents the wants and/or
needs of the user within a problem domain. A good requirement shall be
**atomic** (single purpose), **unique**, **traceable** (back to source),
**complete**, **unambiguous**, **quantitative**, **testable** that identifies
its **owners** and **applicable states**. Such requirement must be **necessary**
and **[documented](202304011057.md) in an accessible way**. All **assumptions**,
if any, shall be stated in a requirement. There are two types of requirements to
be considered [User Requirement](202303251328.md) and [System Requirement](202303251324.md).
In broader sense, we can categorised them into [Functional Requirement](202303251342.md)
and [Nonfunctional Requirement (NFR)](202303251345.md).

**Note**: Requirement typically use the words "shall", "should", and "will" to
express different degrees of mandatory.

**Note**: Ambiguous words such as "[optimise](202203011139.md)", "maximise",
"minimise" etc. are not recommended in requirement statement since there is no
measurable metric for them.

Finding out a requirement can be done with the questions like below:
- Who does it?
- What is done?
- Where is it done?
- When is it done?
- How is it done?
- Why is it done?

Requirements should have identification such as number, goal-hierarchy
numbering, version information, and attributes. The changes to the requirement
must be managed properly by viewing each of them as an individual #configuration
time.

Like [Project](202303251009.md) and [product](202303251030.md), requirements
also have life cycle with the following phase:
1. Elicitation phase (ensure consideration of a broad scope of potential ideas
   and candidate problems)
2. Organisation phase (grouped into functional and nonfunctional requirements)
3. Analysis phase (transformation)
4. [Prototype](202207120959.md) phase (proof of concepts and to induce feedback)
5. Requirements documentation and specification (consolidation into requirement
   list or a document format, then transform into specification)
