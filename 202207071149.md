# Autonomous System (AS)

AS is a #[logical network segment](202207071052.md) that contains several
[Network Devices](202207051821.md)# especially [Routers](202207061800.md)# under
a common administration sharing a common routing strategy. An AS is typically
identified using 16-bit autonomous system number (ASN) given by the American
Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN), an [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](202209271141.md)
or a network administrator. ~~It is a basic unit in~~ Routing inside AS involves
#[IGP](202207071157.md) whereas routing outside AS involves
#[EGP](202207071158.md).

The router inside the AS that connects to other AS is called the *edge router*.

Summarisation of [IP Address](202206281021.md) will happen when there is a need
to transfer the information to different AS.
