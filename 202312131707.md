# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

AWS IAM is a tool that centrally manages access to launching, configuring,
managing, and terminating resources in AWS accounts. Customised
[Authentication](202210040915.md) and [Authorisation](202210221159.md) policies
can be specified by this free service.

IAM manages four main components, that is IAM user, IAM group, IAM policy, and
IAM role. IAM user is a person or an application that can authenticate with an
AWS account via programmatic (CLI or SDK) or management console means. These
users can be grouped together to form a single IAM group where identical
permission can be granted to this particular group. IAM policy defines the
access permission (which resources) and its level in JSON format. IAM role is an
entity that grants temporary access to specific AWS resources in an AWS account
(similar to `sudo` in [Linux](202204081225.md)).

By default, IAM user is denied permission to have access to any AWS resources.
Following the principle of least privilege, any permission should be granted
explicitly. Note that explicit denial precedes explicit allow policy in IAM
policy. The policy may be identity-based, that is attached to one or more IAM
entity (user, group, or role), or resource-based, that is attached to a
resource. Resource-based policy can be defined inline only, i.e., on the
resource itself.

**Note**: Permission is granted at the global scope not
[regional](202312011406.md).

IAM user may participate in multiple IAM groups. However, IAM group can't be
nested, meaning it can't contain yet another group.
