# Static NAT

Static NAT is one of the implementations of #[NAT](202206281817.md)
where all addresses (private and public) are *preassigned*, meaning it needs to
be *configured beforehand*, and it will *not change* during the operation.

Exactly one private address can be mapped to one public address.

It is good for network security since the private address is not visible to the
outside world.

To define static NAT, we run the command `ip nat inside` on the [edge router](202207061800.md)'s
interface that is inside the network and the command `ip nat outside` on its
interface that is outside the network. Then, we create the local address mapping
by running `ip nat inside source static {local-ip} {global-ip}`.
