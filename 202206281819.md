# Static NAT

Static NAT is one of the implementations of #[202206281817](202206281817.md) where all addresses (private and public) are *preassigned*, meaning it needs to be *configured beforehand*, and it will *not change* during the operation.

Exactly one private address can be mapped to one public address.

It is good for network security since the private address is not visible to the outside world.
