# Islam and the Malay

The widespread theory about the conversion of Malay to [Islam](202308151847.md)
is that it is under the Arab's influence after 8th or 9th century. However, some
disputes that it could be under Indian's (like the Indianisation before) and
Chinese's. Nevertheless, it ultimately changes the Malay Archipelagoes' creed,
political, social, judicial, economic, cultural, linguistic, literature, art,
and educational landscape.
