# Protein Tertiary Structure Prediction Simulation-Based Method

The only simulation-based method for [Protein Structure Prediction](202310291139.md)
is [*ab initio* folding](202310301208.md). It is not used to find the native
structure but instead for targets that lack identifiable
[homology](202308160957.md) to proteins of known structure.
