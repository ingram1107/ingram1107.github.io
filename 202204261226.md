# Git Branch Creation

#[202205251209](202205251209.md) Branch could be created using `branch {branch-name}`. If the
branch need to be started at one specific commit, pass a second argument to the
command like `branch {branch-name} {commit}`.

If you want to immediately check out to the branch upon creation, run `checkout
-b {branch-name} {commit}` where the `commit` is an optional argument that
specifies where the starting point the branch should be at. It could be used
alongside with [202205251604](202205251604.md)#.

You could move the branch's starting point afterwards by the option `-f` for the
command `branch`.
