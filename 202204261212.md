# Git Cherry-Pick

`cherry-pick {commits...}` is a powerful tool for introducing individual
commit(s) to the current branch *without incorporating* branches like
[202204261122](202204261122.md) and [202204261123](202204261123.md). The commits will be attached to the HEAD
of the current branch in *ascending* order.

This becomes handy when back-porting certain features or security fixes for the
current branch is desirable. It makes maintaining several versions of product
possible without muddling the main branch's commit history.
