# Documentation Guide

> Document the interface - Explain the implementation

1. Document *what* is done in function interfaces
2. Document the *purpose* of a function using interface comments
3. Describe *how* things are done by function code (adhered to
#[202206171004](202206171004.md))
4. Describe *why* things are done using code comments (additionally the other
alternatives that were discarded)

**Note**: It is best to use [202207132124](202207132124.md)# such as *Doxygen*
(C++ and others) and *Javadoc* (Java) to generate the documentation
automatically.

**Note**: If you are unsure about the behaviour of the function, write down your
assumption and [test](202206201159.md) them.

**Note**: Treat documentation as one of the [views](202207041054.md)# of the
code base.

**Note**: Preferably documenting in one of the markup languages such as DocBook,
Markdown, LaTeX etc. which could be easily converted into other formats, such as
PDF, troff, slide shows, HTML etc., using tools like provided DSSL processor and
Pandoc.

**Note**: Always prefer web publishing as the main documentation publishing
since it will be always up-to-date.

**Note**: Make sure the documentation is in good style and easy to read in terms
of visual presentation. It is recommended by [Hunt et al.](lit/@Hunt1999.md) to
involve readers with early drafts.

## General

For documenting the requirements, try using use case templates or diagrams. They
are effective mediums for communication, especially for the non-technical
people. [The Pragmatic Programmer](lit/@Hunt1999.md) showed an example use case
based on Cockburn's template:

![use-case-template-example](use-case-template-example.pdf)

Use case diagrams can be as simple as the following:

![use-case-diagram](use-case-diagram.png) Maintain a *glossary* where specific
terms and vocabularies, especially those are used frequent in the project, are
defined in order to prevent misunderstanding.

## C/C++

The interface must be documented thoroughly in C/C++ as follows:

```c
/**
 ** @brief use the Heron process to approximate @a a to the power of `1/k`
 **
 ** Or in other words this compute the @f$k^{th}@f$ root of @a a.
 ** As a special feature, if @a k is `-1` it computes the multiplicative inverse
 ** of @a a.
 **
 ** @param a must be greater than `0.0`
 ** @param k should not be `0` and otherwise be between
 ** `DBL_MIN_EXP*FLT_RDXRDX` and
 ** `DBL_MAX_EXP*FLT_RDXRDX`
 **
 ** @see FLT_RDXRDX
 **/
double heron(double a, signed k);
```

**Note**: Write codes literally. Choose variable names that are meaningful.

**Note**: The control flow should be obvious.

**Note**: Write macro in a way that it will not change the control flow in an
unexpected way.

**Note**: Avoid global variable and use [202202081524](202202081524.md) as much
as possible.

## Rust

Rust use documentation string `///` and doc string `//!` for `rustdoc` to output
the comments as HTML. The documentation string could be treated as a Markdown
section, and all the codes written in the code fence could be run by `cargo
test`.

```rust
//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);
///
/// assert_eq!(6, answer);
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Other than `Examples`, there are three more optional sections that we could
elaborate further: `Panics`, `Errors` (function return `Result`) and `Safety`
(`unsafe` function).
