# Network Loop

Network Loop could happen when there is a redundancy within the network, especially in [202207051851](202207051851.md)# and [202207051907](202207051907.md)# network. The packet could be trapped in a circle where they will travel endlessly around the same path. As more and more packets get involved in the loop, the network will inevitably come to a halt as no more bandwidth is available to the hosts due to broadcast-storms (infinite flooding of frames originally for broadcasting), multiple copies of frames (most protocols can't handle duplicated transmissions), and [202206151451](202206151451.md) address table instability (receiving the same frame on different ports).

There are solutions for this:
- Use [202207061800](202207061800.md)# to break up the networks into smaller segments
- [202207081637](202207081637.md)#
