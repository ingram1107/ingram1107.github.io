# Tree

Tree is a data structure that could look like in real life tree. See
[202112102054](202112102054.md)# on how to traverse a tree.

Tree can be used for:
- directory structure

There are several implementations of tree:
- [202112102106](202112102106.md)#
- [202112121935](202112121935.md)#
- [202112102110](202112102110.md)#
- [202112121746](202112121746.md)#
- [202112121857](202112121857.md)#
- [202112121911](202112121911.md)#

## Characteristics

- N nodes = root + (N - 1) edges
- Every node except root must have one parent
- Path of length 0 is the path the node lead to itself
- Exactly one path exists for root to every node

## Analysis

- Most methods could result in $O(\log N)$
