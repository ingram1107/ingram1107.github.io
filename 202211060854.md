# RIP version 2 (RIPv2)

RIPv2 is a #[classless](202210152246.md) #[Distance Vector Routing Protocol](202207071001.md)
derived from #[Routing Information Protocol (RIP)](202210160908.md) to support
discontiguous network, [Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)](202210162049.md)#
and [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)](202210160924.md)#. It uses multicast
IP addresses for routing updates as they take up less bandwidth and require less
processing on other non-RIP enabled devices.

RIPv2 can support discontiguous network by turning off auto summarisation (it is
enabled by default). In [Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md)#
this can be done by `no auto-summary` in the Router Configuration mode.

Enabling RIPv2 could be done in IOS by typing `version 2` right after entering
the Router Configuration mode using the command `router rip` (same as RIP). Same
as RIP, we can redistribute or advertise the routes in the routing table by the
command `redistribute static`.
