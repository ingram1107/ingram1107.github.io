# Terraform Resource Replication

Within #[Terraform Providers](202206072140.md), we can define a resource in such
a way we could replicate multiple instances of them under different name. A
recommended way to do this is by using a [Terraform Meta Arguments](202211242001.md)#
`for_each`. `for_each` will store a list of values, of [type](202206151015.md)#
set or map, into a variable called `each.value`. The following shows the
[configuration](202206061645.md)# example:

```hcl
# In resource file
resource ... {
  filename = each.value
  for_each = toset(var.users)
}

# In variables.tf
variable users {
  type = list(string)
  defaults = [
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Note**: We can convert list to set with the built-in function `toset()`.
