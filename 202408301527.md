# Rust Import Functions From Other Programming Language

Importing external libraries' functions built from other programming languages
can be done with the keyword `extern`, which creates and uses Foreign Function
Interface (FFI) for Rust. Like what we did in [Java Native Interface (JNI)](202312132145.md),
to import the function properly into Rust program, we have to manually specify
parameter(s) and function return type that conform to the original function. The
following codes show how we can do it to import the function `abs` from #c :

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn abs(x: i32) -> i32;
}
```

**Note**: All import functions from other programming languages are treated as
[`unsafe` function](202408301519.md).
