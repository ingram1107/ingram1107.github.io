# Cloud Metrics

Assessing [cloud](202210012158.md) cost could be done through several metrics
according to the perspective in which the entity has taken into.

For providers, they are cost-effectiveness (time-based and performance-based),
incremental cost-effectiveness, cost efficiency, average revenue per server,
average revenue per user, can cost per benchmark. From consumer perspective,
those metrics are supply-chain cost, licence cost, green cost (ecological
damage), [Net Present Value (NPV)](202305061940.md), benefit-to-cost ratio
(BCR), Discounted payback period (DPP), migration cost, and operational cost. We
should also pay attention to the pricing schemes, either it is static or
dynamic.
