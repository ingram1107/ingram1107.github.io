# Earned Value Analysis

Earned value analysis is a quantitative analysis that assesses the
[Project](202303251004.md)'s completeness percentage. In this analysis, the
**budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS)** is determined for each work task in
the schedule ([Gantt Chart](202305140836.md) or [Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT)](202305141720.md)).
During estimation, plan the work in person-month or person-days for each task.
To get the current progress comparing to the schedule, we have to sum up all the
BCWS for all work tasks that *should have been* completed by this point. We can
derive the **budget at completion (BAC)** by $\text{BAC} = \sum{\text{BCWS}_k}$
for all tasks $k$ in the project. The actual work tasks that have been done at
this point is represented by **budgeted cost of work performend (BCWP)**, which
is the sum of the BCWS for all the corresponding tasks. Note that BCWS indicates
the budget of activities that were planned to be completed in contrast to BCWP.

After finding out both BCWS, BCWP, and BAC, we can derive **schedule performance
index (SPI)** (depicts the efficiency of scheduled #resource utilisation of the
project, the closer to 1.0 the more efficient), **schedule variance (SV)** (how
current work progress vary from the schedule), **percent scheduled for
completion**, and **percent complete** with the following formulas:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{SPI} &= \frac{\text{BCWP}}{\text{BCWS}}\\
\text{SV} &= \text{BCWP} - \text{BCWS}\\
\text{Percent scheduled for completion} &= \frac{\text{BCWS}}{\text{BAC}}\\
\text{Percent completion} &= \frac{\text{BCWP}}{\text{BAC}}\\
\end{align}
$$
