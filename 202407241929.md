# Mobile Runtime Environment

Mobile runtime environment should provide safe and managed execution environment
like sandbox to prevent unauthorised access of resources, and contribute to the
development of portable applications. Applications executed in the runtime
environment are usually coded in an intermediate language such as #java byte
code and are [interpreted](202302152053.md) or [compiled](202302152015.md) on
demand before execution.

Examples of mobile runtime environment:
- [Java Platform, Micro-Edition (Java ME)](202407242222.md)
- .NET Compact Frameworks (CF)
- [Dalvik](202407241935.md)
