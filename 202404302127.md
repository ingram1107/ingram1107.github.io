# Semaphore

Semaphore is used in [Tasks or Threads Synchronisation](202404301021.md) in
order to lock critical region upon acquired by the processes or threads. There
are two implementation of semaphore in #unix system: [Semaphore in Pthread](202201291602.md)
and [Semaphore in System V](202212071928.md). A binary semaphore is essentially
a [Mutex](202112061117.md).

Programmers have to be aware on the use of semaphore to avoid the conflict use
of shared resources or using the wrong semaphore. Don't let the process keep the
semaphore to an overly long time, or even worse, not releasing it at all.
