# Memento Pattern

Memento Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that stores an object's
state for later restoration. It involves three participants: **memento** (store
originator state), **originator** (creates and uses memento, see wide
interface), and **caretaker** (safe keep memento, see only narrow interface).
The caretaker first requests a Memento from an originator, and when reverting to
previous state is necessary, it passes the Memento back to the originator.

The Gang of Four suggested to use Memento when:
1. There is a need to save a snapshot of an object.
2. Accessing the state of an object would break the encapsulation.

To implement wide interface only to the originator class, we can make the
originator as a friend class to the Memento in [C++](202302190651.md) as shown
below:

```cpp
class Orignator {
public:
  Memento* CreateMento();
  void SetMemento(const Memento*);
  // ...
private:
  State* _state;
  // ...
};

class Memento {
public:
  // narrow public interface
  virtual ~Memento();
private:
  // private members exposed to Originator only
  friend class Originator;
  Memento();

  void setState(State*);
  State* getState();
  // ...
private:
  State* _state;
  // ...
};
```
