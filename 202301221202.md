# Application-Level Gateways

Application-Level Gateways, or Proxy Server, acts as a relay of
application-level traffic. The user will contact the gateway using TCP/IP
application in which the gateway asks them for name of remote host to be
connected. Appropriate [Authentication](202210040915.md) will be intiated, and
if they are valid, the gateway will contact on the remote hosts and relays the
TCP segments. Each service will have their corresponding proxy separate from
each other.

Comparing to [Packet-Filtering Routers](202301221147.md), it is more secure. It
only need to watch out for a few allowable applications, thus making it easy to
log and audit all incoming traffic. That being said, it adds additional
processing overhead to each connection.
