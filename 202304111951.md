# Network Performance Measurements

With the rapid advancement of the networking technologies, it is rather
ambiguous to describe a network performance in terms of speed as it may differ
over generations. This is due to the nature of the term speed since it is not
*quantitative*. Instead, we should measure the network performance from multiple
aspects, which require different measurements: [latency](202304111955.md),
[throughput](202304111957.md), and [Jitter](202304092135.md).
