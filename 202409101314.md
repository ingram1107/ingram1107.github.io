# Physical Security

Physical security have two parameters: outside perimeter and inside perimeter.
To enhance outside perimeter security, we can install on-premise security
officers, fences, gates, continuous video surveillance, and security breach
alarms. For inside perimeter security, we can install continuous video
surveillance, electronic motion detectors, security traps, and biometric access
and exit sensors.
