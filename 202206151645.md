# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP is a protocol used for automatic #[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)
and [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md) assignment. Using this protocol, the network
will be able to allot an available IP address to a [Network Device](202207051821.md)#
upon requested. It saves up network administrative costs and conserves IP
address space.

By using the command `ip helper-address {ip-address}` on a
[Router](202207061800.md), the router will overrule broadcast rule and get the
IP address from the DHCP server (specified by the IP address given) instead via
DHCP relay agent. We can exclude some IP addresses from the DHCP pool with the
command `ip dhcp excluded-address {ip-address}` then define the pool with name
by executing `ip dhcp pool {name}` in the global configuration mode. To disable
DHCP, we can run `no service dhcp`. Verification on DHCP can be done by running
`show ip dhcp binding` or `show ip dhcp server statistics`.
