# Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

DHCP is a protocol used for automatic #[IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)
assignment. Using this protocol, the network will be able to allot an available
IP address to a [Network Device](202207051821.md)# upon requested. It saves up
network administrative costs and conserves IP address space.
