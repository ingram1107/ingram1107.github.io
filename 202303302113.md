# Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

CDMA is a cellular system utilising spread [spectrum](202302161842.md)
modulation where the signals must be spread or encrypted with a specific code to
distinguish it from other signals. User terminals in each cell communicate with
a base station (point-to-multipoint) located at the centre of the cell where
[FDMA](202303301632.md) and [TDMA](202303301637.md) can be used within it. That
being said, it is limited by multiple access interference. It was widely adopted
by 3G.
