# Transitivity

Transitivity is a valid #[202205062050](202205062050.md) form where if A implies B and B implies C, A must implies C. Its form is shown as below:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \rightarrow q\\
&q \rightarrow r\\
\therefore \ &p \rightarrow r
\end{align}
$$

It is commonly used in #math especially if there are chain of #[202205062055](202205062055.md). For example, if the number is prime, then the number can only be divided by itself, and if the number can only be divided by itself, then it share no greatest common factor (GCF) to other prime number.
