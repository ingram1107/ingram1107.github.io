# Information Assurance

Information assurance is an approach for identifying, understanding, and
managing **risk** through an organisation's use of
[Information](202209291015.md) and **information system**. This includes
all media of information that the organisation may store, process, transmit, or
disseminate (distribute).

There are three key components in information assurance when considering
implementation, which are **people**, **process** (formalised sequence of
actions to achieve a goal), and **technology** (#hardware, #software,
facilities). We should implement AT&E (awareness, training, and education) as
part of the information assurance policy for people to adhere so that such
policy could work. When designing a process to be efficient, we should consider
legal's, regulatory's, contractual requirements', and obligations' impacts to
the process. Additionally, we have to consider [Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)](202305061938.md)
and [Return On Investment (ROI)](202305062039.md) with regard to the three
aforementioned components to determine whether such investment is substantial
and sustainable.

Information assurance policy can be designed in a [top-down ](202408231520.md)
or [bottom-up](202408242238.md) fashion. Factors such as *performance*,
*[Availability](202210022157.md)*, and *coverage* can influence which policy
should be adopted, and we must expect trade-offs to be made.

There are several standards, guidelines, or procedures on auditing information
assurance, listed as below:
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
- Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)
- ISO/IEC 27001

- [Due Diligence Information Assurance](202408142224.md)
