# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

VPN allows individuals sends and/or receives data across public network as if
they are connected to a dedicated private network. For example, people in their
own home can access to their corporate private sites using VPN provided by the
company. This negates the need for [Point-to-Point/Leased Line](202207150843.md).
To avoid eavesdropping, a typical implementation of VPN involves authentication
and encryption using #[IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md).

VPN [encrypts](202209281130.md)# the traffic in [Network Layer](202206131702.md).
