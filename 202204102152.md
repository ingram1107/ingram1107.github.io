# Version Control Hygiene

Practising good version control hygiene could improve the process of
[debugging](202203131236.md) and backtracing. Practise it alongside with `git
blame`.

Follow the rules below:

1. Keep changes small and localised.
2. Fix commits must not mix with other unrelated things such as new feature
   implementation.
3. One fix commit for exactly **one fix on one bug**.
4. A fix commit must include its updated test assets.
5. The fix commits should be clear and concise (more elaborate)
