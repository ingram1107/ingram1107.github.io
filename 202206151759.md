# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

UDP is a widely used #[Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
[Protocol](202209302229.md)# (defined by #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md)
for the #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
Unlike [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md), it is an
unreliable and connectionless protocol that doesn't have [Network Congestion](202209302043.md)
control which is great for real time communication such as voice chat or video
streaming. UDP doesn't guarantee that the packets or datagram (its
[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md))# will reach their destination or
arrive in order as there is no mean to acknowledge such state. It has a rather
small segment headers, with only 8 bytes, and provides fine application control
over data transmission, which allow application-specific error recovery at
[Application Layer](202206131856.md)# for reliability.

`traceroute` utilises UDP for displaying possible routes and transit delays by
sending UDP against the destination port.

Examples of UDP:
- [Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md)#
- [Network File System (NFS)](202302131659.md)
