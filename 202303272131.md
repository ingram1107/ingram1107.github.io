# Data Service Unit/Channel Service Unit (DSU/CSU)

DSU/CSU is a dual-function device that interface a computer to a digital circuit
from [TelCo](202209271141.md) due to incompatibility of computer network data
circuits and telephone system counterpart. The DSU portion handles the data,
that is translates data between digital format used on the carrier's circuit and
the digital format used by the computer. The hardware interface for DSU, under
56 Kbps, is RS-232, and over it, uses other high speeds interface like RS-449 or
V.35 standard. The CSU portion handles line termination and diagnostics
including a loopback test facility (transmit a copy of all data that arrives
across the circuit back to the sender without further processing). CSU can use
either an #encoding that guarantees a balance (e.g., differential encoding) or
bit stuffing to prevent excessive 1s or currents on the cable.
