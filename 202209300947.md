# Domain Name Server (DNS)

DNS provides a mean to translate between #[IP Address](202206281021.md) and
domain name such as "google.com", "archlinux.org", "mmu.edu.my" etc. If DNS is
not available or disable within a network, the hosts will not be able to request
services with domain name and even loss connection to the Internet entirely.
