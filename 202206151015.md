# Terraform Variable

Variable can be defined in a `variable` block in
#[HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)](202206061645.md) for
#[HashiCorp Terraform](202205041220.md) in the file `variables.tf`. A
comprehensive definition for a `variable` block should look like the following:

```hcl
variable filename {
  default: "Hello World"
  type: string
  description: "To say hello world to the outside world"
}
```

The `default` field defined the default value for the variable `filename`. This
must adhere to the **type** that you have specified in the field `type`.
`description` is generally used for documenting. All these arguments are
optional, so we can actually define an empty variable block without triggering
any warnings or errors.

The values of the variables can be assigned else where. You can put their values
inside a file named `terraform.tfvars` or `terraform.tfvars.json`, or any file
that has post-fix `.auto.tfvars` or `.auto.tfvars.json`. The following shows the
syntax to define these files, which is similar to of the style of JSON file:

```json
filename = "Hello World"
isComputer = true
total = 45
```

We can even define the value for the variables using environment variable or the
command option `-var` before running `terraform apply`. If the environment
variable is intended to refer to the variable defined in `variables.tf`, they
need to have a format `TF_VAR_{variable name}` in order to be recognised by
Terraform. In the case of `-var`, you can simply define them in the style `-var
{variable name}={value}`. For every variable, one `-var` should be used.

The precedence of defined values for the variables is like this: environment
variables has the lowest precedence, next the `terraform.tfvars` and its JSON
counterpart, then `auto.tfvars` and its JSON counterpart, and `-var` and
`-var-file` has the highest precedence. Higher precedence of defined values will
override the lower one.

If the `variable` block doesn't contain the default value of the variable and
its value can't be found in all the method mentioned above, then Terraform will
prompt for the value.

To use or import variables into another file, we can utilise the prefix `var` in
the format form of `var.{variable name}`. For example:

```hcl
resource "local_file" "example" {
  filename = var.filename
}
```

**Note**: There are some variables defined in the resources are *read-only*,
meaning we can't override or assign values to them.

We could convert the value from the [Terraform Providers](202206072140.md)#
using the `output` block to output the variable *onto the screen* or be used by
*external program* such as [Ansible](202204272021.md) and shell scripts. It
accepts only one parameter, that is the name for the to be defined variable. The
mandatory argument for it is `value` argument, which is used to refer to the
value from the resource block. `description` is a description for this output
variable, but it is optional.

```hcl
output "file_id" {
  value = local_file.example.id
  description = "This is an example usage of output block"
}
```

Output variables could be inspected using the command `terraform output`.

## Type

There are several types available to enforce type checking for a variable,
including `string`, `number`, `bool`, `any`, `list`, `map`, `set`, `object` and
`tuple`. We can define it in the field `type` within the `variable` block.

`list` can be treated as typical array, meaning you could access the elements
inside the `list` using the `[]` syntax with an index number starting at 0.

For `list`, `map` and `set`, we can constrain the type of these collections by
using the syntax `()`. The following code takes advantage of this to restrict
the `list` to only accept boolean type values:

```hcl
variable a_list {
  default = [true, false, true]
  type = list(bool)
}
```

`set` is almost identical to of `list`, except that it doesn't allow repeated
values. A `list` could be converted to `set` with the function `toset()`.

`map` has a minor differing syntax to `list` and `set`. It accepts a key and a
value where you can later retrieve it using `[]` with the key name. This is best
shown as an example:

```hcl
variable a_map {
  default = [
    "key1" = "This is the first value"
    "key2" = "This is the second value"
  ]
  type = map(string)
}
```

The type `object` has a similar syntax to `map`. We can assign multiple types of
variable to an `object`. This is shown as below:

```hcl
variable an_object {
  default = {
    first-var = "Hello World"
    second-var = 420
    thrid-var = ["cat", "dog", "rat"]
  }
  type = object({
    first-var = string
    second-var = number
    thrid-var = list(string)
  })
}
```

As you can see, it uses a different bracket `{}` to define an object. Note that
the key name must be the same to the key name declared in the `type` field.

`tuple` can be defined to include a collection of variables coming from
different types. It uses `[]` to define the type information of the variables.

```hcl
variable a_tuple {
  default = [true, "dolphin", 69]
  type = tuple([bool, string, number])
}
```
