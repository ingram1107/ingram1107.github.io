# Soft Real-Time System

In contrast to [Hard Real-Time System](202403301928.md), soft
[Real-Time System (RTS)](202403301908.md)'s time requirement is not as important
as failure to meet the requirement, occasionally, will not impair the system.
Examples of such system are banking system, web browsing, online reservation
systems, etc.
