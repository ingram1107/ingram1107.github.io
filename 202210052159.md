# Permutation/Transposition Cryptography

Permutation/Transposition Cryptography is a #[Cryptographic](202209281121.md)
method that encrypt a message by rearranging the plaintexts. This includes
changing [Encoding](202205202129.md)# system of the plaintexts. Since it doesn't
alter the frequency of letters from the original plaintext, it is vulnerable to
[Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)#. It is even more dangerous to group the
ciphertext in group that match the key size used by the cipher.

A [Cryptanalytic Attack](202209281257.md) done on Permutation/Transposition
Cryptographic algorithm is by first guessing period, try all possible
permutation on the period ([Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md)), search for
common patterns and then use lists of common diagrams and trigrams
([Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)#).

The examples are:
- Using geometric figure to write and read out following the pattern
- [Rail Fencer Cipher](202211061023.md)#
- [Row Transposition Cipher](202211062143.md)#
- [Block/Columnar Transposition Cipher](202211062154.md)#
