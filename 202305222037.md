# Asynchronous CMC

Asynchronous CMC is a [Computed Mediated Communication (CMC)](202305222032.md)
where the conversation happen remotely and at different times. This kind of
conversation can be read at anytime and place, thus giving great autonomy and
control to respond. It can be sent to multiple people at once. Things that have
larger emotional impact can be interacted easier in this form. However, it may
result in flaming (angry email expressed in uninhibited language), message
overload, and poor response time.
