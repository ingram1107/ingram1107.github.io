# Perl Reference

We could create a reference to a variable (could be [Perl Array](202209201839.md)#
or [Perl Hash](202209221254.md)#) by using `\` syntax such as follows:

```perl
my $var = "hi";
my $refToVar = \$var;
print $refToVar;  # Output: SCALAR(0x812e6ec) or something similar
```

As shown, a Reference will be [Autovivified](202207192226.md)# into string,
which means that it can't point to a string as it is a string itself. If it is
evaluated, it will always return [true](202207211219.md)#. To dereference it, we
could add an extra `$` to the reference:

```perl
# with scalar variable
my $derefRefToVar = ${$refToVar}; # or
my $derefRefToVar = $$refToVar;   # if there's no ambiguity
print $derefRefToVar;  # Output: "hi"

# array or hash
my $hashRef->{key} += 5   # hash
my $arrayRef->[1] = 'red' # array
```

**Note**: There is a library call `Data::Dumper` that could take any types and
print it in a human-readable form. This is quite useful when printing a
structure such as an array and a hash.

We could deep copy a data structure from a Reference using the function
`dclone()` imported from `Storable` module (with `use Storable dclone`).

A referent (referenced #[Perl Variable](202212051001.md)) will not be garbage
collected once out of scope. This means that the variable is still alive in the
memory but it can't be accessed via name (variable name). Instead, it should be
referred with the corresponding reference name.
