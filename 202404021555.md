# Stream Transport

Stream transport in [Internet](202206151238.md) is a [connection-oriented](202206151232.md)
[Network Communication Paradigm](202404021553.md). It establishes **two
streams** between a pair of communication applications, one in each direction.
There is boundaries or restrictions on how many bytes should be sent at a time.
The application may generate one byte at a time or generate blocks of bytes of
data. Network may combine smaller blocks into larger blocks or vice versa when
delivering packets from one host to another host.
