# Hybrid System

Hybrid system is an [Interrupt Only System](202404141448.md) where interrupts
can occur at both fixed frequencies and sporadically. Sporadic interrupts can
have the highest priority as they may be used to handle critical error.

Sometimes, round-robin scheduling is combined with
[Pre-emptive](202404141550.md) policy. Higher priority
[Process](202210062301.md) can pre-empt lower priority task, and if two of them
are of equal priority, then a round-robin scheduling is adopted.
