# Kubernetes StatefulSet

StatefulSet is a component from #[202201291535](202201291535.md) that define a blueprint and
build up abstraction for stateful #[202201311630](202201311630.md) replication. It is usually
used for database construction. For stateless pod see [202201311650](202201311650.md). 

## Replications

Unlike in [202201311650](202201311650.md), replicas in StatefulSet will have a **static** pod
identity which is ordered numerically and will not change even after
re-scheduling. Their ID are usually displayed as `app-id` and their domain name
name will be displayed as `app-id.service`.

The first ever created replica will be the **master**, whereas the rest of them
will be as **workers**. They will have their own storage to read into but only
master has write access to its storage. All the replicas will continuously
synchronise their state and data.

If there is a new replica created, it will copy state and data from the **most
recently** created replica. After those are done, it will join the
continuous synchronisation with other replicas.

If it is needed to delete replica, they will be deleted in **order** rather in
random. Additionally, the deletion will be done in reverse order.

**Note**: Replicas cannot be created or deleted at the same time!

**Note**: If all the replicas dies, all the data could be lost! It is wise to
have a [202202151901](202202151901.md) so that the data stored does not tie to the lifetime of
those pods.
