# Network Layer

Network layer is the third layer in #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md),
and it is commonly referred as Internet Layer in #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
This is where most of the communication protocols operate. It is responsible for
addressing, packaging and routing functions. The header that it adds to the
*packet*, which is its #[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md) includes
the source and destination [IP Address](202206281021.md)# which are unique.
[Routing](202207061815.md)# and fragmentation (breaking large packet into
smaller ones based on *maximum transmission unit* (MTU)) is done in this layer.
We can understand network layer in three components: the [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md),
[routing components](202207061815.md), and reactive component responsible for
error handling and request for networking information. The latter is usually
handled by [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md).


Although in this layer, the checksums are computed and verified, the packet will
be discarded assuming the higher level layer protocol will retransmit the packet
that contains the error.

Several protocols are operated in here:
- [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)#
- [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)#
- [Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)](202209271135.md)#
- [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](202209301002.md)#
- [Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)](202209301003.md)#
- [Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)](202209302315.md)#
- [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)#
- [IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)#
- [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](202211101623.md)#
- [Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP)](202303021157.md)
