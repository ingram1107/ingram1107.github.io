# Network Layer

Network layer is the third layer in #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md),
and it is commonly referred as Internet Layer in #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md).
This is where most of the communication protocols operate. It is responsible for
addressing, packaging and routing functions. The header that it adds to the
*packet*, which is its #[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md) includes
the source and destination [IP Address](202206281021.md)# which are unique.
[Routing](202207061815.md)# is done in this layer.

Several protocols are operated in here:
- [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)#
- [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)#
- [Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)](202209271135.md)#
- [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](202209301002.md)#
- [Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)](202209301003.md)#
- [Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)](202209302315.md)#
- [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)#
- [IP Security (IPsec)](202210052208.md)#
- [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](202211101623.md)#
