# Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

HCI is a study of interaction between human and computer. The aim of the HCI is
to improve the interaction quality as much as possible while at the same time
shorten the interaction time. When doing a design on HCI, there are several
factors should be taken into account: the **users**, the **activities**, and the
**context** (where the interaction is taking place). Due to the current user
behaviour trend, the need of the user are compulsory to be met by the product,
and instead the user's wants should be addressed.

Drawing user needs can be done by taking into account what people are good in
and bad at certain activities. The final product should consider what may help
to improve the user's quality of life. Other than that, listen to the user's
wants and get them involved in the product's #design process and #development.
We could use tried and tested user-centred methods. See more in [The Pragmatic Programmer](lit/@Hunt1999.md).
