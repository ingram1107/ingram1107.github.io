# Monoalphabetic Cipher

Monoalphabetic Cipher is a #[Substitution Cryptographic](202209281136.md)
#algorithm that shuffle the letters arbitrarily ([random](202207162147.md))
which has a key size of 26 letters. The total number of keys are $26! = 4.03
\times 10^{26}$. However, since in Monoalphabetic Cipher the relationship
between the letter in a plaintext to the letter in a ciphertext is always
one-to-one, it is vulnerable to [Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)# due to
the fact the frequency of the letters is not altered.

Examples of Monoalphabetic Cipher including:
- [Playfair Cipher](202210300859.md)#
- [Hill Cipher](202210300928.md)#
