# Client-Server Architecture

Client-server architecture is a [System Architecture](202303242154.md) where the
processing tasks are divided between networked clients and a central server. In
typical architectural design, client will handle the entirety of the [user interface](202303242118.md)
including data entry, data query, and screen presentation logic whereas server
will provide data access and [database management functions](202302101137.md)
and [store the data](202302101139.md).

**Note**: Since server could be a client for another server, pay attention to
the dependency tree to avoid circularity.

The system is structured into 4 main logical layers, i.e., presentation layer,
data management layer, application processing layer, and
[Database](202302101139.md) layer.

Depending on the responsibility bear on the client, we can group the client into
**fat client** or **thin client**. Fat client or thick client describes a client
that performs all or most application processing logic, which means the need of
frequent data access and update, thus has higher requirement of network
bandwidth. Due to its bandwidth demand, it often has slower performance
comparing to its thin counterpart. Furthermore, it requires higher initial and
maintenance cost since more powerful hardware is required and more program code
resides on the client. That being said, fat client is much easier to develop as
the server could be simple and to serve more clients without being high-end.
Since the processing logics are all or mostly reside on the client, fat client
can work independently of the server. It is mainly the product delivered by a
[software development house](202304262205.md).

Thin client describes a client merely act as an interface to the server as all
or most of the processing logic resides on the server. Owe to this, thin client
has lesser need of bandwidth, faster performance, and lower initial and
maintenance cost (utilising pool of licences resides on the server instead of
assigning exact number of clients with the licences). However, the development
of a thin client is not as easy since the programmer has to consider the
[optimisation](202203011139.md) related to [concurrent access and processing](202202011815.md)
especially the data performance during traffic spike and the possibility of corruption.

A common client-server architecture design is the *two-tier design* where the
application logic may either run on the client, the server, or be divided
between them. In contrast, another design, *three-tier design*, delegates the
request processing on an independent [Middleware](202304201955.md) that connects
both the client and server. This middleware often termed as application server,
where the server that store the data is termed as data server. Comparing to
thin client, it has better performance, and comparing to fat-client, it is
easier to manage. Furthermore, three-tier approach is more scalable in the case
of demand increases. However, this of course come in the cost of heavy loaded
network and difficult debugging process.

Comparing to [Mainframe Architecture](202304202043.md), it has a rather flexible
architectural structure with elastic, fast, and [object-oriented](202202041514.md)
application development. It gives power to the users to improve their
productivity with GUI, mostly PC-based. The processing either
[online](202304202000.md) or [batched](202304202003.md) can be shared or
configured in anytime. There are some options to store the data close the
client which may improve the data exchange performance. Most client-server
architecture adopts a multivendor model on #hardware and/or #software
[integration](202303242149.md) which is very flexible. That being said, this
come in the cost of decentralise #security and control which is difficult to
protect.
