# Guide to Write Mathematical Proofs

To write a functional [Mathematical Proof](202302281137.md), follows the below
steps:
1. Copy the statement of the theorem to be proved on your paper.
2. Clearly mark the beginning of your proof with the word *Proof*.
3. Make your proof self-contained. That is to explain the meaning of initial
   variables and those introduced later (what kind of object they are), like
   declaration in #programming-language.
4. Write your proof in complete, grammatically correct sentences. (Symbols can
   be used)
5. Keep your reader informed about the status of each statement in your proof,
   especially the assumption that you made.
6. Give a reason for each assertion in your proof (coming from the hypothesis of
   the theorem, definition of one of the terms in the theorem, result obtained
   previously in the proof, or established or well known assumed mathematical
   result).
7. Map your arguments with clear and concise phrases or words to make the logic
   of your arguments clear.
8. Display equation and inequalities.

Avoid the mistakes such as:
- [Arguing from Examples](202206172053.md)
- Using the same letter to mean two different things
- [Jumping to a Conclusion](202206172053.md) (doesn't give adequate reason)
- [Circular Reasoning](202206172053.md)
- Confusion between what is known and what is still to be shown (can be avoided
  by not to introduce a variable unless it is either part of the hypothesis or
  deducible from it)
- Use of *any* rather than *some* (the ambiguity of the word *any*)
- Misuse of the word *if* (may cast doubt on an assumption, where in fact it is
  certain)

**Note**: If you get stuck in writing mathematical proof, try finding a limited
but true statement for the same statement given. Other way to find a proof is by
trying different theorem that fit into the case.
