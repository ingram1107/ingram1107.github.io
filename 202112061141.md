# Routine in Pthread

Routine is a context of content that is going to be exectued by a thread. We can
simply treat a routine as a function.

To create a routine in Pthread, we could simply declare a `void *` function with
a parameter of type `void *`. Pass in the function and its parameter into the
third and forth parameter of `pthread_create` correspondingly for the thread to
execute. In order get the return value from the function, we need to obtain the
value from the second parameter of `pthread_join` with a casting of `void **`.

```c
void *routine(void *arg) {
  int value = *((int *)arg);
  value++;
  *((int *)arg) = value;
  return arg;
  // pthread_exit(arg); /// alternative to return
}

// in the main program
int *arg = malloc(sizeof(int));
*arg = 5;
pthread_create(&th, NULL, &routine, (void *)arg);
pthread_join(th, (void **)&arg);
free(arg);
```

**Keep in mind** that we need to dynamically allocate memory for the argument
and the return value, then free them afterwards. The best practice is to use the
same pointer for both the arugment and the return value of the routine.

Be aware that if the argument is access by multiple threads, there will be a
concern over [202112061109](202112061109.md)# if those threads are able to read from and write
to the arguments without restriction.
