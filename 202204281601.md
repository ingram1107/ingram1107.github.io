# Cartesian Product

A Cartesian Product of two #[set](202204281446.md) $A$ and $B$, is the set of
all #[ordered pair](202204281552.md) $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
This means it is a concatenation of two sets. It is denoted as $A \times B$
which read as "A cross B". This could be expressed in [set-builder notation](202204281700.md)#
as $A \times B = \{(a, b) \in S|a \in A \ \text{and}\ b \in B\}$.

**Note**: The number of elements of set $A \times B$ is the product of the
number of elements of set $A$ and $B$. ($n(A \times B) = n(A) \cdot n(B)$)

The Cartesian Product of two $\mathbb{R}$ (from [commonly used set](202204281506.md)#)
could be displayed in [Cartesian plane](202204281721.md)# as a coordinate.
