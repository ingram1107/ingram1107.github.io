# Cartesian Product

A Cartesian Product of two #[202204281446](202204281446.md) $A$ and $B$, is the set of all
#[202204281552](202204281552.md) $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. It is denoted as $A
\times B$ which read as "A cross B". This could be expressed in
[202204281700](202204281700.md)# as $A \times B = \{(a, b) \in S|a \in A \ \text{and}\ b \in
B\}$.

**Note**: The number of elements of set $A \times B$ is the product of the
number of elements of set $A$ and $B$. ($n(A \times B) = n(A) \cdot n(B)$)

The Cartesian Product of two $\mathbb{R}$ (from [202204281506](202204281506.md)#) could be
displayed in [202204281721](202204281721.md)# as a coordinate.
