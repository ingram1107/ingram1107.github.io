# SQL Authorisation

[Structured Query Language (SQL)](202302231241.md) offers the
[Authorisation](202210221159.md) service with the `grant` statement. For
example, the following SQLs shows granting `select`, `update`, `insert`, and
`references` (permits declaration of foreign key constraint to other relation
that is not owned) privilege on the [relation](202302101331.md) `department`.

```sql

grant select on department to Alice, Bob;
grant update (budget) on department to Alice, Bob;
grant insert (dept_name, building) on department to Alice, Bob;
grant references (dept_name) on deparment to Alice, Bob;
```

**Note**: There is a `public` user which refers to all current and future users.
Thus, granting privileges to `public` is granting privileges to all database
users.

To simplify the chore of granting rights to the same group of entities, we can
create role with, you guess it, the command `create role`, and then assigned the
user to the role with `grant`. Furthermore, we can grant the created role to
another role, just like assigning user to a role.

```sql
create role instructor;
grant instructor to Alice;
grant select on department to instructor;
```

By default, the user or role can't grant their privileges to other users or
roles. This can be change by the clause `with grant option` appended to the
`grant` like the following:

```sql
grant select on department to Alice with grant option.
```

Revoking the privileges from users or roles can be done with the `revoke`
statement. If user $U_1$ has granted privileges to $U_2$, the revocation of
$U_1$'s privileges will also affect $U_2$ (*cascading revocation*, due to
implicit `cascade`). To avoid that, we can append keyword `restrict` to the
statement.
```sql

revoke select on department to Alice, Bob;
revoke update (budget) on department to Alice, Bob;
revoke insert (dept_name, building) on department to Alice, Bob;
revoke references (dept_name) on deparment to Alice, Bob;
```

There might be a situation where one should retain the role granted by other
user in which the latter was strip of their role. With cascading revocation,
the former will lose their role granted before. To prevent such situation, we
can make that so when a user granted a role to other user, it ends with the
statement `granted by current_role` to set the `current_role` as the role that
grant the privileges to the latter.
