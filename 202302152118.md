# Just In Time (JIT) Compiler

JIT is a [hybrid implementation system](202302152122.md) that
[compiles](202302152015.md) the intermediate language (such as byte code in
Java) to machine code when called and keeps the machine code for subsequent
calls. It improves the compilation time of a programming language without
sacrificing too much execution time.
