# Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP)

MSTP, defined by 802.1s standard, is an alternative of
#[Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)](202207081637.md) that maps multiple
[Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)# with similar topologies to a single
[Spanning Tree](202207081445.md)# instance. This drastically reduces the overall
number of spanning tree instances which improves the traffic load balancing and
network recovery time, as the set-up of the instance can be CPU-intensive.
