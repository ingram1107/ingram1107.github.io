# Multiple Spanning Tree (MST)

MST, defined by 802.1s standard, is an alternative of
#[202207081637](202207081637.md) that maps multiple
[202207061741](202207061741.md)# with similar topologies to a single
[202207081445](202207081445.md)# instance. This drastically reduces the overal
number of spanning tree instances which improves the traffic load balancing and
network recovery time, as the set-up of the instance can be CPU-intensive.
