# Net Present Value (NPV)

NPV calculates the expected net monetary gain or loss from a project by
discounting all expected future cash inflows and outflows to the present point
in time. This is based on the assumption that the value of money could be
depleted in the future due to inflation. Such assumption is formulated into
[discount rate](202305061944.md). However, the project completed in year 0, that
is the current year will not be affected by the discount rate as the latter
only discount the later years' value. Calculating NPV can be done with the
following formula:

$$
\text{NPV} = \text{total discounted benefits} - \text{total discounted costs}
$$

Where:
- Total discounted benefits is the sum of all discounted benefits, calculated
  from multiplying the benefit with the discount factor.
- Total discounted costs is the sum of all discounted costs, calculated
  from multiplying the cost with the discount factor.

**Note**: NPV will have the same value with the result of final year cumulative
benefits and costs.

**Note**: Cumulative benefits and costs is calculated based on the subtraction
of year $n$'s discounted benefits and costs and year $n - 1$'s cumulative
benefits. Initially, both discounted benefits and costs, and cumulative
benefits and costs are the cost of year 0.

A positive and higher NPV is preferred as it indicates that the return from a
[Project](202303251004.md) exceeds the capital cost.

**Note**: Negative value is recorded in the format of (value).
