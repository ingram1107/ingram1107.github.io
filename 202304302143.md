# Purposeful Perspective QA

Purposeful perspective QA, aka validation testing, is one of the
[Quality Assurance (QA)](202304302045.md) approaches which tests the system
whether it adheres to the [client's needs](202303251328.md). Since this kind of
QA is done from the client's perspective, the system is often treated as a black
box like in [Functional Perspective QA](202304302141.md).
