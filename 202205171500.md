# Aliasing

Aliasing is when different symbolic names can access to the same object that is
stored in the memory. This could be a hassle for
[Optimisation](202203011139.md)# as the ordering of the procedure could be
different due to assumptions made by compilers.

In C programming, all base types except `unsigned char` does not support
aliasing.
