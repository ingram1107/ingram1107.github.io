# Evolution of Organisation Drivers In Internet

Businesses, governments, and other entities have successfully going through 4
stages of evolution in adapting Internet into their services. At first, they
build a simple #html website as information board for advertisement and/or
announcement. As the web technologies progress, an ecommerce (EC) site can be
built where selection and/or ordering can be done through Internet. Later,
[virtual enterprise](202407241921.md) is available, so that services from
different companies or branches can be tied together through a single user
interface. Nowadays, people are looking forward to Next Generation Enterprise or
Government (m-business or m-government) that adds [Mobility](202303292141.md),
self-serve customers, [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) etc. on top of
the existing virtual enterprise.
