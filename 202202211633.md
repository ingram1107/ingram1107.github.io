# Container

Container is an isolated environment exists in user space that use system
resources allowed by #operating-system. It doesn't rely on hardware
virtualisation. Instead, it utilises the operating system virtualisation.

Because of this, container is more lightweight, has faster startup and uses less
memory than [Virtual Machine](202204071131.md). However, since containers share the same
underlying [Kernel](202210062254.md)#, they are less secure than virtual
machine. We could follow the DevSecOps principle to constraint the container's
security vulnerability.

Container's lifetime is tie to its process which is running inside it. It will
die as soon as the process finished its execution.

There are different types of container:
- [Application Container](202204071114.md)#
- [System Container](202204071117.md)#

## Technologies

In different operating system, containment implementation could vary.

- [Linux Container (LXC)](202204071041.md)#
- [Windows Containers](202203281443.md)#
- [macOS Hypervisor Technology](202203281448.md)#
