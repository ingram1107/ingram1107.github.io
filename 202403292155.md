# Trace Caching

In Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) [architecture](202403151651.md),
instruction decoding sometimes take several stages in the
[pipeline](202403292159.md). Trace caching solves this problem by caching raw
byte sequence [L2](202403191017.md) and storing decoded instructions in L1i.
This allows the processor to skip over first steps of pipeline in the case of
cache hit especially when the pipeline stalled.
