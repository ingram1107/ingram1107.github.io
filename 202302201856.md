# Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)

SIP is an [Application Layer](202206131856.md) signalling
[Protocol](202209302229.md) used ~~to set up [IP](202206151223.md) connection~~
initiating, maintaining, and terminating #communication sessions. It locates the
IP address of the target and decides which codec to used to encode the media
([voice](202303201850.md), [video](202302201418.md), image etc.) where an
SIP-URI is used for identifying a user since it contains user's name and
associated domain name. For conference calls, multicast is used in SIP. There
are two kinds of packets in SIP: signalling packet (to establish IP connection)
and media packet (where the content encoded).

There are six basic message types or methods defined in SIP listed below:
- INVITE (session creation)
- ACK (acknowledge INVITE)
- BYE (session termination)
- CANCEL (abort pending request)
- REGISTER (registration of user's location)
- OPTIONS (query to determine capabilities of called party)

SIP involves interaction between devices such as *user agent* (initiate or
terminate calls), *location server* (user information
[Database](202302101139.md)), *proxy server* (request forwarding), *redirect
server* (call forwarding and 800-number connections), and *registrar server*
(receive registration requests and update location server consulted database).

A typical SIP procedure works as describe next. A user agent A locates one of
the proxy server configured in itself via DNS server. After that, proxy server
will initiate SIP methods on behalf of the user agent A to the target, which
will be first query at one of the location server that the proxy server know. If
the target, say a user agent B is valid, then an exchange of acknowledge between
these two user agent happens, and later they establish a communication session
which both of them can directly interact with.
