# Python Descriptor

Python Descriptor, i.e., `__set__`, `__get__` and `__delete__`, is defined as
per attribute instead of as per class unlike `__setattr__`, `__getattr__`, and
`__delattr__`. It is widely used in functions, properties (`@property`), class
methods and static methods, slots, `__dict__`, validators and super view lookup.
