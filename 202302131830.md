# Screened Host Firewall System with Single-Homed Bastion Host

This [Screened Host Firewall System](202302131829.md) consists of
a [Packet-Filtering Router](202301221147.md) and a [Bastion Host](202301221214.md).
The router is configured in a way that only packets from and to the bastion host
are allowed to pass through. Comparing to single configuration, it provides
greater security as it implements both [packet-level](202206131837.md) and
[application-level](202206131856.md) filtering and the
[Intruder](202301021642.md) must penetrate two separate systems. This
configuration can afford flexibility in providing direct Internet access. That
being said, if the router is compromised, then the traffic can flow directly
through it between the Internet and other host in the private network.
