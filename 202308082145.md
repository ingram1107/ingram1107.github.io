# Genetic Information Flow

Genetic information flow starts from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which could
either be duplicated via [DNA replication](202308091148.md) or copied into
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) via [Transcription](202308091156.md). Protein
could be seen as the final product of the DNA done through the mRNA via
[Translation](202308091201.md) synthesised using the information in mRNA as a
template. RNA itself could be replicated, or synthesises DNA with RNA template
via reverse transcription as shown in some virus such as SARS-COVID-2. Some
proteins could be synthesised directly from a DNA template without mRNA.
