# Genetic Information Flow

Genetic information flow starts from [DNA](202308082154.md) which could either
be replicated via [DNA replication](202308091148.md) or copied into precursor
messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA) via [Transcription](202308091156.md). The
pre-mRNA will later be spliced into mRNA with 5' and 3' untranslated region
(UTR). Protein could be seen as the final product of the DNA done through the
mRNA via [Translation](202308091201.md) synthesised from [Open Reading Frame (ORF)](202308142028.md).
RNA itself could be replicated, or synthesises DNA with RNA template via reverse
transcription as shown in some virus such as SARS-COVID-2. Some proteins could
be synthesised directly from a DNA template without mRNA.

**Note**: Promoters and enhancers in DNA determine which part of the DNA is to
be transcripted.
