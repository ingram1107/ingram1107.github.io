# Genetic Information Flow

Genetic information flow starts from deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which could
either be duplicated via DNA replication or copied into messenger ribonucleic
acid (mRNA) via transcription. Protein could be seen as the final product of the
DNA done through the mRNA via translation that synthesised using the information
in mRNA as a template. RNA itself could be replicated, or synthesises DNA with
RNA template via reverse transcription as shown in some virus such as
SARS-COVID-2. Some proteins could be synthesised directly from a DNA template
without mRNA.
