# Flexibility Principles

Flexibility principles focus on the multiplicity of ways the user and system
exchange information. It considers **dialogue initiative** (system freedom
imposing constraints on input dialogue via system pre-emptiveness with modal
dialogue boxes or [user pre-emptiveness](202304161040.md)), #multithreading
([concurrent](202202011815.md) or interleaving), **task migratability** (the
ease of sharing or delegation of task execution between user and system,
preferably automatic), **substitutivity** (allows equivalent values of input and
output to be substituted for each other), and **customisability**.

**Note**: It is advised to minimise the system pre-emptiveness and maximise the
user pre-emptiveness.
