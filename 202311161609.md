# Cloud Network

Cloud network is responsible for connecting storage and [virtual servers](202305311448.md)
optimally. It typically has elasticity (against demand), autonomic networking,
geo-distribution, high [Availability](202210022157.md), and programming
interface. It is built using [Network Devices](202207051821.md) that are
physically connected together. Cloud network usually has a
[hierarchical](202212062234.md) architecture (three-layer or two-layer with high
density aggregation switches) with multiple layers to help to connect resources
to the Internet, coupled with the interconnection to improve in
[Convergence](202210242111.md) and performance.
[Virtualisation](202311161439.md) is also used to help create a logical view on
the network that is flexible and easily configurable.

It helps in creating network isolation or separate network segments for
applications. It allows the configuration of [Network Security](202209262107.md)
with [Firewall](202301211140.md), [Authentication](202210022151.md), and
[Authorisation](202210221159.md). Cloud network helps in [Load Balancing](202210242151.md)
amongst the application server instances and steering the traffic as desired.
[Virtual Private Network (VPN)](202207150909.md) could be used to secure
in-enterprise connectivity. It is extendable. The exposed network configuration
is treated as a service in the form of APIs.

Cloud network management system is responsible for configuring the cloud
networks and monitoring the network for #performance and faults. Authorisation
and authentication may also be included.
