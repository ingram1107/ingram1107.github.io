# C++ Container

Containers in #[C++ STL](202202241717.md) are continuous memory structures that adhere to
[RAII](202202012306.md) principle. They possess the ownership of their own objects.

They can be categorised into 3 types:
- *sequence*, like `array`, `list`, `forward_list`, `deque`, `vector`, and
  `mdspan` (1D structure to represent multidimensional array)
- *associative*, like `map` and `set`, which is built using binary search tree
- *unordered associative*, like `unordered_map` and `unordered_set`, which is
  built using hash table

Most of them are [iteratable](202202241727.md) and can be deduced from their
built-in [Template Deduction Guide](202204182011.md). The iterator then can
iterate through first to last.

Standard libraries' containers usually define `value_type` and `iterator` to
indicate what type of the value and iterator are stored or used in them. It is
advised to follow this convention if a custom container should be used. This
could be useful if [Compile Time Type Determination](202204181536.md) should be
used in the codebase although in C++20, [C++ Concepts](202203281200.md) is the
better alternative for it.

The default [C++ Allocator](202205161742.md)# for containers are `new` and
`delete`. You could change it in order to [optimise](202203011139.md) the memory
usage.
