information and services instantly. ~~[Protocol](202209302229.md) for mobile
wireless connection~~ It is intended for data entry or display on [cellular phones](202303292214.md).
It has a complete protocol stack similar to [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)
but optimised for wireless information pull and push [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
and above across multiple wireless technologies. The protocol stack contains
[Wireless Application Environment (WAE)](202305171408.md), [Wireless Session Protocol (WSP)](202305171416.md),
[Wireless Transaction Protocol (WTP)](202305171420.md), [Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP)](202305171433.md),
