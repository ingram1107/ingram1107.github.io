# Internet Protocol (IP)

IP is the underlying protocol used by World Wide Web (WWW) to connect other
computers over the network which is included in the
#[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md). It is considered as
#[Network Layer](202206131702.md) protocol according to
#[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md). It provides the
unreliable packet delivery service for protocols such as [TCP](202206151232.md),
[UDP](202206151759.md), and [ICMP](202209270927.md). Since it provides no hard
guarantees on network requirement, it allows interoperability of different
[Data Link Layer](202206131651.md) protocols and increases its extensibility by
adding server with installed [Application Layer](202206131856.md) protocols.
Currently, it has two versions: [IPv4](202206151453.md)# and
[IPv6](202206281129.md)#.

**Note**: Because it is unreliable or connectionless in nature (some said it
provides *best-effort service*), it needs other protocols like
[Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)](202304092140.md) to guarantee [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md).

**Note**: IP protocol relies on [Routing Protocol](202207061815.md) to make
routing decisions on the [Router](202207061800.md) instead by itself.

The size of an IP datagram usually range from 20 to 65536 bytes. Its structure
is like the following:
1. Header, size range from 20 to 60 bytes
2. Data
3. VER, indicates the version of the IP used, 4 bits or half a byte of size
4. HLEN, indicates the length of the header, 4 bits or half a byte of size
5. DS, specifies the type of [Differentiated Service](202209301020.md)#, one
   byte of size
6. Total length, indicates the total length of the datagram, 2 bytes of size
7. Identification, used to identify the packet, 2 bytes of size
8. Flags, 3 bits of size
9. Fragmentation offset, used to identify the order of the packet if
   fragmentation was done on the packet, 13 bits of size.
10. Time to live (TTL), specifies the life time of the packet, 1 byte of size
11. Protocol, specifies the protocol used, 1 byte of size
12. Header checksum, used for error controlling, 2 bytes of size
13. Source [IP Address](202206281021.md)#
14. Destination IP Address
15. Option (optional)

The following table shows the possible value of Protocol field to indicate which
[Protocol](202209302229.md)# is in used:

| Value | Protocol                                                      |
| ---   | ---                                                           |
| 1     | [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)#  |
| 2     | [Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)](202209271135.md)# |
| 6     | [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#       |
| 17    | [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)#              |
| 89    | [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](202211101623.md)#           |
