# Internet Protocol (IP)

IP is the underlying protocol used by World Wide Web (WWW) to connect other
computers over the network which is included in the
#[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md). It is considered as
#[Network Layer](202206131702.md) protocol according to
#[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md). It provides the
unreliable packet delivery service for protocols such as [TCP](202206151232.md),
[UDP](202206151759.md), and [ICMP](202209270927.md). Since it provides no hard
guarantees on network requirement, it allows interoperability of different
[Data Link Layer](202206131651.md) protocols and increases its extensibility by
adding server with installed [Application Layer](202206131856.md) protocols.
Currently, it has two versions: [IPv4](202206151453.md)# and
[IPv6](202206281129.md)#.

**Note**: Because it is unreliable or connectionless in nature (some said it
provides *best-effort service*), it needs other protocols like
[Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)](202304092140.md) to guarantee [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md).

**Note**: IP protocol relies on [Routing Protocol](202207061815.md) to make
routing decisions on the [Router](202207061800.md) instead by itself.
