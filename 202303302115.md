# Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA)

SDMA utilises share [spectrum](202302161842.md) and partially distribute the
user terminals through smart directional antennas. These antennas minimise the
interference between terminals, reduces power needed, and induces stronger
signal by transmitting signals directly to its target. Radio signals can be
separated with multibeam antennas by pointing them along different directions.
