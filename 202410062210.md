# FM Repeater

FM repeater consists of two radios, one for receiving an input frequency and
another for transmitting an output frequency, a duplexer (frequencies isolation
and rejection), and a repeater controller. It is typically used in VHF and UHF
[Amateur Radio](202408231247.md) to extend their range due to their limited line
of sight (LoS) propagation. It is usually located on a hill, mountain, or any
tall structure.

Repeater controller is responsible for routing audio from receiver to
transmitter, detecting COR from receiver, triggering PTT on transmitter when
accessed, introducing tail or hang time before PTT drops once transmission was
seized, and transmitting identification in CW or voice at predefined interval.

There are three parameters to be considered when operating an FM repeater:
**output frequency**, **input frequency shift/offset**, and **CTCSS tone**. The
input frequency shift is an offset between the input and output frequency of the
repeater, which is defined as -600 kHz for 2 m shift and -5 MHz for 70 cm shift.
CTCSS tone is used to avoid unwanted key up due to QRM or interference from
non-repeater users. Transceiver can access the repeater with built-in repeater
shift and CTCSS tone encoding function, assuming that the transceiver dial is
set to the output frequency of the repeater.

Advance FM repeater allows remote control with DTMF.
