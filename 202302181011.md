# Rashidun Caliphs

The Rashidun or legitimate caliphs referred by the Sunni Islamic scholars are
[Abu Bakar Asy-Siddiq](202302181017.md) (got the title Asy-Siddiq as Abu Bakar
follow every word from the prophet Muhammad), [Umar bin Al-Khattab](202302190619.md),
[Uthman bin Affan](202302241122.md), and [Ali bin Abi Talib](202302241134.md).
They reigned after the death of the prophet from 632 to 661. Some Islamic
scholars dispute in the ground that Hassan bin Ali, the successor to his father,
should be included in counting legitimate caliphs. This argument becomes the
basis believe for Shi'a Muslims. Other also argues that caliph Umar bin Abdul
Aziz should be included too. Nevertheless, the title was passed down from Hassan
bin Ali to [Muawiyah bin Abu Sufyan](202302241557.md), the governor of Syria,
who will then establish the [Umayyad Caliphate](202302241657.md), by force, thus
ending the First Fitna (first Muslim Civil War).
