# Malaysia's Economic Policies

Malaysia social-economic life has been plagued by wide household income gap and
unequal wealth distribution among different ethnics and between urban and rural
populations. To address the issue, Malaysia government had pushed three
consecutive economic policies which are New Economy Plan (Dasar Ekonomic Baru,
from 1971 to 1990), National Development Policy (Dasar Pembangunan Nasional,
from 1991 to 2000), and National Outlook Policy (Dasar Wawasan Nasional, from
2001 to 2020).

NEP is a reaction to the 13 May incident in order to calm down ethnic tensions
raised from the social-economic issues. Not only aiming to reduce the poverty
(membasmikan kemiskinan), it also strives to rearrange the social structure. It
is due to the fact that majority of Malay population worked in the primary
sector, that is farming and fishing, whereas others mostly worked in the more
lucrative secondary sector.

In support to this policy, the government also pushed the legislation of
Industrial Coordination Act (ICA) that splits the corporate shares into 3 parts
shared among different ethnics (30% Malay, 30% Indian, and 40% Chinese). Other
government agency also established to further the efforts on reducing the
poverty line, including FELDA, MARA, FAMA, MARDI, RISDA, MAJUIKAN, and PERNAS.
