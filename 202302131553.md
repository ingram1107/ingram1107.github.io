# Storage Area Networks (SAN)

SAN is an independent network specifically designed to connect storage devices
utilising [Storage Networking](202302131647.md). It removes the device,
operating system, and location dependencies of traditional
[DAS](202302131604.md), which allow storage expansion without server impact, on
demand bandwidth, and load-balancing. It offers centralised control for
monitoring, back, replication and provisioning, any-to-any connectivity between
storage and servers, highly [available](202210022157.md) disk services
(redundant paths between servers and storage devices), and highly scalable and
location-independent disaster recovery.

Several components exist in a SAN such as host-bus adapters,
[storage systems](202302131604.md), [Ethernet Hub](202207061148.md),
[Switch](202207051907.md), and SAN-management software.

Two access methods are allowed for SANs: [Fibre-Channel](202302131547.md) and
[Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md).
