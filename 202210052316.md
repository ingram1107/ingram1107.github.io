# Double Data Encryption Standard (2DES)

2DES is one of the implementation of #[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md).
It does *two times* DES algorithm on each block to [encrypt](202210052211.md)#
the message. Although it is an improvement to DES, it is still vulnerable to
[meet-in-the-middle (MITM) attack](202210061036.md)#.

The following uses mathematical notation to show the cryptographic scheme:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &= E_{K2}[E_{K1}[P]]\\
P &= D_{K1}[D_{K2}[C]]
\end{aligned}
$$
