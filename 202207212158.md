# Conjunction

Conjunction is a valid #[202205062050](202205062050.md), stated that if a statement is true, and another statement is true, then the conjunction of them (which is an and statement) is also true.

$$
\begin{align}
&p\\
&q\\
\therefore \ &p \land q\\
\end{align}
$$

For example, if "The book has a red cover" is true, and "The room is clean" is also true, then we can conclude that "The book has a red cover and the room is clean" which is valid.
