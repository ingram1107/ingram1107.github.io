# Communication System

The purpose of a Communication System is to transmit information from one point
to another with *high efficiency and reliability* that is acceptable to user.
With the use of [Source Coding Theorem](202209291028.md)#, the communication
channel could be more efficient since the redundancy are reduced from the
message signals. With the use of [Channel Coding Theorem](202209291049.md)#, the
reliability of the transmission will be improved even though it also introduces
systematic redundancy.

Unfortunately, in practice, there will always be noise and other transmission
impairment that influence the source symbol in the channel, which retain some
uncertainties even after observing the output. We described them with
[Conditional Entropy](202210261349.md)# and [Mutual Information](202210261345.md)#.
