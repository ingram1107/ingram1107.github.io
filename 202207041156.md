# Blackboard System

A blackboard system is a highly #[decoupled](202202041514.md) system based on
tuple space which has the following characteristics:
- Modules doesn't need to know each other existence
- Modules watch the board for new influx of information, and add their own if
  needed
- The data or information may come in many forms such as integer, graphics, data
  structure and so on
- Modules may have vastly different responsibility between each other
- The lifetime of the modules could be varied, and interact with the blackboard
  in different period

If implemented correctly, it can be of great replacement to the popular
#[Model-View-Controller (MVC)](202207041054.md). The following shows the example
of libraries or implementation of such system:
- JavaSpaces
- T Spaces
