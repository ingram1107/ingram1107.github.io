# Classful Routing Protocols

Classful Routing Protocols are the [Routing Protocols](202207061815.md)# that
follow the [Fix-Length Subnet Masking](202210152323.md)#. However, as the
networking technologies advanced, most Classful Routing Protocols are phased out
in favour of [Classless Routing Protocols](202210152246.md) due to the
limitation of Classful Routing Protocols to travel to different [Address Classes](202206280922.md)
since the routing update doesn't include the network mask.

Examples of Classful Routing Protocols:
- [Routing Information Protocol (RIP)](202210160908.md)#
- IGRP
- Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
