# Password Entropy

Password Entropy is an empirical way of comparing potential strength of a
password by determining its [Entropy](202209291005.md). The larger the entropy
is, the more secure the password. Although both the length and complexity (more
character combination) of a password influences its entropy, the length plays a
more substantial role in increasing the Password Entropy.

Consider using one letter from A to Z as your password, we can know its Password
Entropy, assuming each letter shares the same possibility of occurrence, by
calculating:

$$
\begin{align}
p &= \frac{1}{26}\\
H(P) &= \sum^{K-1}_{K=0} p \times \lg (\frac{1}{p})\\
&= 26 \times \frac{1}{26} \lg (26)\\
&= 4.7004
\end{align}
$$

This means that an [attacker](202209281128.md) can guess your password by asking
4 to 5 questions. How does them do that? It is done by eliminating possible
ranges of occurrence instead of by trial and error.

If the password length is more than one, we'll use the following formula to
calculate the Password Entropy:

$$
H(P^n) = nH(P)
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the length of the password

Considering having 10 characters password, [randomly](202207162147.md) chosen
from both lowercase and uppercase English alphabets, we'll have 47 bits of
entropy from that password. This is verifiable by comparing the number of
possible combination to 2 with a raise exponent of Password Entropy.

$$
k^n = 2^{H(P)}
$$

Where:
- $k$ is the number of possible characters used
- $n$ is the length of the password

For commercial world, an 80-bit entropy password[^weaver2016] is good enough
against [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md), that is 15 characters long
password that doesn't include special characters.
