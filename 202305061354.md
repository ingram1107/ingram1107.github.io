# Analytical Evaluation

Analytical Evaluation doesn't involve end-users in the system
[testing](202206201159.md). It can be categorised into *inspections*
(**heuristic evaluation** and **cognitive walkthroughs**) and *theoretically
based models* (**modelling**).

Heuristic evaluation is a one-by-by approach of analytical evaluation to check
the knowledge of typical users is applied based on common assumption and
[usability guidelines](202304081725.md).

[Cognitive](202304291456.md) walkthroughs involve experts in walking through
scenarios with application [Prototypes](202207120959.md).

Modelling is primarily for comparing the efficacy of different interfaces for
the same application, and optimal arrangement and location of features on the
interface base.
