# Key Duplication

To duplicate a key, first make sure that the clown key has the same length as
the original key. Measure the third teeth with a gauge for later comparison.
Then, depending on the situation, align the keys on the vice of the key
according to their shoulders or tips. After than, copy the key by cutting the
same pattern on the clone key. Smooth the key with the bench grinder. If the
resulting key's third teeth height is within 0.20 unit errors, then the clone
key is functional as the original key.
