# Syntax Analyser

Syntax analyser is responsible for large-scale language constructs such as
expressions, statements, and program units. These language constructs are
usually parsed into a tree form. There are mainly two implementation of syntax
analyser: **top-down**, that is parsing from root to leaves, left to right
([pre-order](202112102054.md), or leftmost derivation), and **bottom-up**, that
is parsing from leaves to root, right to left (rightmost derivation). Example of
top-down approach of syntax analyser is LL parser (the first L denotes the read
of input from left to right, the second L denotes leftmost derivation). Example
of bottom-up approach of syntax analyser is LR parser (the L denotes the read of
input from left to right, the R denotes rightmost derivation).
