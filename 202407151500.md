# Timing Constraint

Timing constraints can be categorised into two groups:
- [Behavioural Constraint](202407151502.md)
- [Performance Constraint](202407151503.md)

Each of them can be further classified into three types:
- [Deadline Constraint](202407151758.md)
- [Delay Constraint](202407151759.md)
- [Duration Constraint](202407151802.md)
- [Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM)](202407151812.md)
