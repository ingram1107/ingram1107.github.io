# Adaptive Life Cycle Model

Adaptive life cycle model is an iterative approach to [System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](202303251030.md)
that should be used on mission driven and component based projects with
ambiguous requirements. It usually involves time-based cycles to meet target
dates. Examples of adaptive life cycle model:
- eXtreme Programming (XP, [Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md))
- Scrum (requires strong leadership, best for #oop [Projects](202303251004.md))
