# Entity-Relationship Model (E-R)

E-R Model is a [Data Model](202302101219.md) that uses a collection of basic
objects, named *entities* (table), that represent thing in real world that is
unique from other objects, and *relationships* among them. The *attributes* of
an entity are represented using columns. Furthermore, there could be mapping
cardinalities that define the number of entities can be associated in a
relationship to another entity.
