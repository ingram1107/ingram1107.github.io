# Entity-Relationship Model (E-R)

E-R Model is a [Data Model](202302101219.md) that uses a collection of basic
objects, named [entities](202304191954.md) (represented as a table), that
represent thing in real world that is unique from other objects, and
[relationships](202304192107.md) among them. The [Attributes](202304200943.md)
of an entity are represented using columns. Furthermore, there could be mapping
cardinalities that define the number of entities can be associated in a
relationship to another entity. It could be seen as an enhancement to
[Relational Model](202302101331.md).

It is advised to not have redundant attributes in different tables and treat the
connection between two tables as a uniform relationship instead as an attribute
in one of them. The latter advice make the logical relationship clear and
unambiguous and avoid premature assumption of the [Mapping Cardinality](202304290909.md).
