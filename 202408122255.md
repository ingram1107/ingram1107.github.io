# Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)

WEP was part of the security infrastructure of [IEEE 802.11](202303292155.md),
responsible for data encapsulation (password
[Confidentiality](202210022150.md)). However, due to its severe security flaw,
it was replaced by [Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)](202303021618.md) and
eventually [Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2)](202303021606.md). Other
improvements include Fast Packet Rekeying.

WEP [MAC](202206151451.md) sender first encrypts the [frame](202206131651.md)
body of the data frames, not including frame's headers and non-data frames. As
such, it is weak against [Analytic Attacks](202212172229.md). The encryption
scheme implemented is based on [RC4](202210121510.md) ([Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md)),
but the standard doesn't specify key distribution. The initialisation vector
(IV) is sent in clear text, and adding to the injury there is no standard on IV
generation, which means that different NIC vendors can have the same sequence of
IV or fix value. The CRC-based integrity check is inferior to hash or message
authentication scheme.

WEP also employs [Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)](202408122229.md)
which is susceptible to [Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM)](202210061036.md) attacks.
The authentication is asymmetrical, meaning that the wireless station can't
authenticate [Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md), and there is no specified key
management in WEP standard.
