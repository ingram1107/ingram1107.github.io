# Pseudo-Terminal

Pseudo-terminal is a pair of virtual character devices on Linux providing
bidirectional #communication channel. It's implemented as a loop-around device
like [Stream Pipe](202306300811.md). Like actual terminal, it also includes the
[Terminal Line Disciplines](202307011338.md). One end of the channel is called **master**,
and the other end is **slave**. Slave end acts as an interface to the
pseudo-terminal in order to make the shell think that it is interacting with a
terminal which in fact is another application like `vi`, meaning there is no
need to pass the `-i` (interactive) flag to the shell.

To make the slave end of the pseudo-terminal to be the controlling terminal, we
have to disassociate its parent process from its original control terminal to
make this possible. This could be done by making the parent process to be the
group leader with the [Unix System Call](202210062303.md) `setpgrp()` then open
the pseudo-terminal. Becoming the controlling terminal is important as the
output executed can be redirected to the slave end instead of the actual
terminal.

**Note**: [Linux](202204081225.md) follows the practice in System V aka Unix 98
for controlling terminal matters.
