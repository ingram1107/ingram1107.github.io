# Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)

BLAST is an algorithm for identifying [Homologous](202308160957.md)
[DNA](202308082154.md) or [protein](202308082207.md) sequences and comparing
primary biological sequence information.

It could have several programs such as:
- blastn or Nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST
- blastp or Protein-protein BLAST
- blastx or Nucleotide 6-frame translation-protein

**Note**: blastx is said to be more reliable and accurate when dealing with
coding DNA as protein sequences are better conserved evolutionarily.
