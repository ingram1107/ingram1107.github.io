# Class Inheritance

Class Inheritance is a type of [Object-Oriented Programming](202202041514.md)
inheritance that defines an object's implementation in terms of another object's
implementation. It is different from [Interface Inheritance](202302042025.md).
Reuse modules with such method are called **white-box reuse**, as the internals
of the parent class are usually visible to subclasses, which is in constrast to
[Object Composition](202302051222.md). Although it is defined statically in
compile-time, the behaviours or the implementation of the object will be hard to
modified during runtime. And since the implementation of the parent class are
exposed to its children, it is often said that the inheritance *breaks
encapsulation*, thus increase the coupling between two objects (implementation
dependency).
