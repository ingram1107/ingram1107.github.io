# Understand a Bug

Understand a bug is essential in #[debugging process](202203131236.md) in order to
fix the defects implied in the [problem report](202204081514.md). The following is
the recommended steps in helping to shape your understanding in the bug:

1. Locate the lines of code that you think is causing the trouble
2. Why is the code wrong?
3. Determine a proposed classification (??)
4. Formulate a set of proposed changes
5. How will such changes affect the runtime states of the program?
6. Why will the changes correct the problem?

There are important practices that could deepen your comprehension on the bug:

- Inspect and verify the **test assets**
- Be **open-minded** and question all parts of the program
- Try to prove the defects is **not there**
- Try to explain why the defects **is there** and why your proposal will **fix**
  it.
