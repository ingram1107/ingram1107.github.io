# Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns a group of [Design Patterns](202211221249.md)
abstracting the class instantiation including object creation, composition, and
representation. They are useful in when the system depends more on [Object Composition](202302051222.md)
as these patterns encapsulate the underlying concrete class used, and the class
creation and composition. In other words, they provide the flexibility on what
gets created, who creates them, how it creates them, and when. We can categorise
creational design patterns into **creational class pattern** (using class
inheritance) and **creational object pattern** (delegate tasks mentioned to
other objects).

Example of creational class pattern:
- [Factory Method Pattern](202302232101.md)

Examples of creational object pattern:
- [Abstract Factory Pattern](202303271021.md)
- [Builder Pattern](202304291133.md)
- [Prototype Pattern](202304081512.md)
- [Singleton Pattern](202211231900.md)
