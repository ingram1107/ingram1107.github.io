# End-to-End Congestion Control

End-to-end congestion control is a method of [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
that observes the network by looking at indirect cues such as packet loss and
delay without explicit support from the [Network Layer](202206131702.md).
[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md) takes this congestion
control approach.
