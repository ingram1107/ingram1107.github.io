# Load Balancing

Load Balancing is the ability of a [Router](202207061800.md) to distribute
packets among *multiple same cost* paths. We can view it as a method of
assigning load to [Network Devices](202207051821.md) to optimise the network
#performance and boost [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md). Using
[Equal Cost Load Balancing](202210242155.md)#, it could be done as per
destination (fast switching) or per packet (process switching). In addition, the
network administrator could do Unequal Cost Load Balancing, where they could put
arbitrary variance to influence the cost of a link, with IGRP and EIGRP.
