# Load Balancing

Load Balancing is the ability of a router to distribute packets among *multiple
same cost* paths. Using [Equal Cost Load Balancing](202210242155.md)#, it could
be done as per destination (fast switching) or per packet (process switching).
In addition, the network administrator could do Unequal Cost Load Balancing,
where they could put arbitrary variance to influence the cost of a link, with
IGRP and EIGRP.
