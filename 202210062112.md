# End-to-end Encryption (e2e)

e2e occurs between the original source and the final destination, that is the
encryption is happened in either [Application Layer](202206131856.md)#,
[Presentation Layer](202206131853.md)#, [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)# or
[Network Layer](202206131702.md)#. This implies that they have the shared keys.
e2e only concerns about the encryption of the user data. If user's privacy and
security is desirable, then e2e is preferred. However, due to the translation
limit when jumping between different network technology such as
[IPv4](202206151453.md)# and [IPv6](202206281129.md)#, the data sent must be
decrypted and then be transformed to an understandable form. This could be a
huge compromise.

It doesn't protect the traffic flow as in [Link Encryption](202210062110.md).
