# Reliability

Reliability is a statistical measure on [System](202303242148.md)'s ability to
provide functionality when desired by the user. Such system must include
#hardware, [firmware](202304201955.md), and #software. **Mean Time Between
Failures (MTBF)** is one of the metrics for reliability measurement.

$$
\text{MTBF} = \frac{\text{total time in service}}{\text{number of failures}}
$$

See more in [Availability](202210022157.md) for the calculation of MTBF.
