# Hostname Naming Convention

There is a naming convention around hostname in order to have a clear networking
structure over a network. As specified, the name should:
- start with a letter,
- contain no spaces,
- end with a letter or digit,
- use only letters, digits, and dashes, and
- less than 64 characters in length.
