# Trapdoor One-Way Function

Trapdoor One-Way Function is a [One-Way Function](202211072036.md)# with
additional information that is known to the user so that the function is easy to
compute and invert if all the information is given. However, if one of the
information is not known, it is infeasible to invert.

For example:

$$
\begin{align}
Y &= f_k(X)\\
X &= f_k^{-1}(Y)\\
\end{align}
$$

Given both $k$, $X$ and $Y$, it is easy to compute both function. However, if
the $k$ or $Y$ is not known, the corresponding algorithm will be hardly useful
for inverting.
