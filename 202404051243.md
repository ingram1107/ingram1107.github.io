# Microcontroller

Microcontroller is a self-contained system with I/O peripherals, main memory,
and [processor](202404051142.md). It is built with
[Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)](202404051246.md) which resulted
in less power usage and more immunity to power spikes. Microcontroller also uses
little computation resources, often time being manufactured as a single chip,
resulted in reduced size and lessen cost. It is commonly deployed when input and
output are clearly defined.
