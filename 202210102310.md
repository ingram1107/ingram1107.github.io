# Kraft-McMilan Inequality

Kraft-McMilan Inequality defines the limit of the code word lengths in a
#[prefix code](202210102241.md).

$$
K = \sum^{n}_{i=1} r^{-l_i} \le 1
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the size of the source alphabet $s_k$
- $r$ is the encoding form (usually in binary)
- $l$ is the length of the code word

It is a [necessary condition](202205062030.md)# for a prefix code to be
constructable.
