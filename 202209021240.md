# Multimode Fibre-Optic Cable

Multimode #[Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md) is composed of three layers, from
outer layer to inner layer: *the coating* that protects the inner layers, *the
cladding* that keeps light in the core, and the *silica* or *plastic core* that
carriers the signal. The light could propagate in the form of multiple
wavelengths where each could take a slightly different path due to its large
core diameter (typically 50-100 Âµm, larger than [Single-Mode Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021249.md)).
However, its covering distance is much shorter, less than 2 km, due to possible
dispersion.
