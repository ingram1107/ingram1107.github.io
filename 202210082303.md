# Field

Field is a [Set](202204281446.md)# $S$, together with two operations $+$ and
$*$, which has the following properties including those in
#[Group](202210082221.md), #[Abelian Group](202210082309.md),
#[Ring](202210082256.md), #[Communicative Ring](202210082310.md), and
#[Integral Domain](202210082323.md):
- Multiplicative inverse, which means If $a \in S$ and $a \not = 0$, $\exist
  a^{-1} \in S, aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = 1$

In [Modular Arithmetic](202210090858.md)#, the find the multiplicative inverse
of a number $a$ is by the equation, where $a$ is [relatively prime](202210092214.md)
to $n$:

$$
\begin{align}
a * x &\equiv 1 (\mod n) \text{ , or} \\
ax + bn &= 1
\end{align}
$$

From here, we could also know that:

$$
a \equiv x^{-1} (\mod n)
$$

Thus found the inverse of $a$ in modular sense. To do that, we utilises the
[Euclidean Algorithm](202210092226.md)# and extends its steps on $a \mod n$ as
follows:
1. Do one round of Euclidean Algorithm on the modulo.
2. Apply the properties $a = qn + b$, transform it to $b = a - qn$.
3. If $b$ is 0, we can conclude that $a$ is not relatively prime to $n$, which
   means there is no solution for it. Otherwise, continue.
4. If $b$ is 1, substitutes accordingly using the equations generated in step 2.
5. Utilise the property where $n \mod n = 0$, produce an equation resembles $1 =
   a * x (\mod n)$.
6. Reconstruct the equation to $a^{-1} = x (\mod n)$ which is identical to $a =
   x^{-1} (\mod n)$, thus found the solution.

**Note**: If $n$ is a prime number, then every number from $1$ to $n - 1$ is
relatively prime to $n$ and has an exactly one inverse modulo $n$ in the range.

**Note**: We could check the answer by determining whether $xa^{-1} \mod n = 1$.
If yes, then the answer is correct.

Or we could instead use [multiplicative table](202210100956.md)# or trial and
error by using the formulae $a^{-1} \times x = 1 \mod 5$ to find out the answer.
