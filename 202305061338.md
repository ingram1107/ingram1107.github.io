# UI/UX Evaluation

Evaluation is a part of the [Interaction Design (ID)](202303242118.md) process
that collects information about user or potential [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md)
when interacting with a [Prototype](202207120959.md), computer system, a
component of a system, or a design artefact. It focuses on both [Product Usability](202303242139.md)
and UX. It is recommended to follow the [DECIDE framework](202305061419.md).

Combining with [iterative approach](202305061342.md), evaluation aims to check
that users can use (heterogeneous or different needs) the product and like the
interaction via a [Conceptual Model](202304152151.md), early and later
prototypes in natural and laboratory settings throughout the design process. An
important takeaway is that the shipped-out product can be evaluated later to
collect information to inform new products.

There are three main approaches to UI/UX evaluation, which could be either
composed together to have a broad understanding of the efficacy of a design or
done it opportunistically:
- [Usability Testing](202206201428.md)
- [Field Study](202305061405.md)
- [Analytical Evaluation](202305061354.md)
