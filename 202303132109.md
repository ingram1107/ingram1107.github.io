# Proxy Pattern

Proxy Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that provides a placeholder
(same interface) for another object to control access (creating and deleting) to
it. In other words, it maintains a reference that lets the proxy access the real
subject. There are different kinds of proxies: **remote proxy** (local
representation in different address space), **virtual proxy** (creates on demand
or [Copy-on-write](202203251058.md), **protection proxy** (protect access), and
**smart reference** (counts number of references like [Smart Pointers](202111301656.md)
and provides [lock](202112061117.md), free it when count goes to zero).

Most proxies can be implemented with operator overloading (in
[C++](202302190651.md), pointer operators such as `->` and `*`), but virtual
proxy requires to load the object at a specific time instead of when it gets
referenced. Therefore, operations for virtual proxy should be implemented
manually.
