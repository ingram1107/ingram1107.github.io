# Stream Cipher

Stream Cipher processes messages (plaintext) a bit or byte as a stream at a time
when encrypting or decrypting. It typically has a pseudorandom *keystream* which
can be used to destroy statistically properties in message, as shown in the
following formulae:

$$
-C_i = m_i \oplus \text{ streamkey}_i
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertext
- $m$ is the message in plaintext

However, the keystream should be of [one use](202209281248.md)# to prevent the
possible recovery of the plaintext. Therefore, Stream Cipher exhibits the
properties where it will encrypt the data with long period with no repetitions
and statistically random. Though it does rely on large key size and have a large
[linear complexity](202201171844.md).

Examples of Stream Cipher are:
- [RC4](202210121510.md)#
- SEAL
- HC-256
