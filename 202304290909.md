# Mapping Cardinality

Mapping cardinality or cardinality ratio represents the number of
[Entities](202304191954.md) that associate with another entity via a
[Relationship Set](202304200933.md). This could be **one-to-one**,
**one-to-many**, **many-to-one**, or **many-to-many**.

One-to-one relationship could be expressed rather simplistically as shown in
[Relationship Set](202304200933.md). Binary many-to-many relationship set's
primary key is the union of all the primary keys from participating entity sets
whereas binary one-to-one relationship set could be either of them. For binary
many-to-one or one-to-many, the primary key should be the primary key from the
"many" entity set.

On relationship [Attribute](202304200943.md)'s assignment, the attribute should
be placed on the "many" [Entity Set](202304191956.md) for one-to-many
relationship, on either for one-to-one relationship (depends on the enterprise's
[Requirement](202303251303.md)), or on the relationship set for many-to-many.
