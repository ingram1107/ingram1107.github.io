# Mapping Cardinality

Mapping cardinality or cardinality ratio represents the number of
[Entities](202304191954.md) that associate with another entity via a
[Relationship Set](202304200933.md). This could be **one-to-one**,
**one-to-many**, **many-to-one**, or **many-to-many**.

One-to-one relationship could be expressed rather simplistically as shown in
[Relationship Set](202304200933.md). Binary many-to-many relationship set's
primary key is the union of all the primary keys from participating entity sets
whereas binary one-to-one relationship set could be either of them. For binary
many-to-one or one-to-many, the primary key should be the primary key from the
"many" entity set.
