# Fennel Testing

It is possible to use `busted`, a Lua module that provides [Unit Testing](202206201320.md),
for Fennel's module unit testing. However, we have to direct `busted` to find
Fennel modules with the following codes:

```lua
local fennel = require('fennel')
fennel.install()
debug.traceback = fennel.traceback
```

The above codes are required to be imported each time a unit test module is to
be run under `busted`. Thus, the best way to further reduce the error-proneness
is by putting it into a separate file like `helper.fnl`, and call `busted` from
the command line: `busted --helper helper.fnl -- test/unit-tests.lua`.
