# Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric Cryptography aka Public-Key Cryptography is a
#[Cryptographic](202209281121.md) system, first introduced by Whitefield Diffie
and Martin Hellman in 1976, that involves usage of pair keys that perform
unequal functions. Such keys are commonly denoted as: **private key** and
**public key**. The generation of two keys typically requires very large
numbers, thus rendering it slow when comparing to [Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md).

As the name suggests, private key can only be hold by the local host whereas
public key can be shared among the hosts, or recipients, in the network. Both
the public key and private key are encrypted by a cryptographic algorithm. ~~The
public key can only be decrypted by the matching private key, which identify the
intended receiver.~~ Public key is used to *encrypt messages* and *verify
signatures*. Private key is used to *decrypt messages* and *sign (create)
signatures*. Once the message get signed, it is
[non-repudiation](202210022159.md)# as there is only one owner for the private
key and they can't deny to the ownership of the key.

The requirements for a secure Asymmetric Cryptographic scheme, defined by Diffie
and Hellman in 1976, is to have easily computed *key pair generation*,
*encryption*, and *decryption*, but [computationally infeasible](202209281245.md)#
to determine *private key* given public key and recover *plaintext* given public
key and ciphertext. Furthermore, the order of the encryption and decryption
shouldn't matter. Encryption can be done first then decryption or the other way
around.

It addresses two issues faced by [Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md):
[Key Distribution](202210062203.md)# and [Digital Signature](202210040909.md)#.
One doesn't need to have a secure channel or a [third party](202210062220.md) to
distribute public keys as it will not sufficient to undermine the security of
the encrypted message. Public keys could be distributed by either
[Public Announcement](202210122221.md)#, [Publicly Available Directory](202210122225.md)#,
[Public-Key Authority](202210122229.md)#, or [Public-Key Certificate](202210122233.md)#.
We can verify whether the message is coming from the intended sender using the
public key, thus able to authenticate the author. That being said, it is
vulnerable to quantum computing.

In addition, it is a must for an Asymmetric Cryptographic scheme to be resistant
against [Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA)](202209281257.md)# since owning the
public-key render a full control over the encryption algorithm. Otherwise, the
scheme would be useless.

It is rather common for Asymmetric Cryptography to complement
[Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md) in order to
[distribute session keys](202210062203.md)# securely (which is used to encrypt
and decrypt the message contents). There are several ways to do it:
- [Simple Secret Key Distribution](202210131013.md)#
- [Hybrid Key Distribution](202210131021.md)#
- [Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](202209012218.md)#

Example of Asymmetric Cryptography:
- [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)#
- [Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md)#
- [Digital Signature](202210040909.md)#
- Key exchange of session keys
- [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](202210312227.md)#
