# Public-Key Authority

Public-Key Authority utilises [Publicly Available Directory](202210122225.md)#
but tighten the control over #[public key distribution](202203221212.md). Before
the user could talk to the other user, they are required to obtain public key by
interacting with the directory in real-time when needed. And the user must know
the public key of the directory in order to be able to interact with it.
