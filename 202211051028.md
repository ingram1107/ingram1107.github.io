# Static Routing

Static Routing is a static way to configure the #[Routing Table](202210112056.md)
of a [Router](202207061800.md)#. It is static as not reactive to external
changes such as topology changes. Usually, this is done manually by the network
administrator in order to have some sort of control over route configuration.
One particular example is using static route in a stub network, where there is
only one route for the network to be accessed. We could simplify the network
routing by using route summarisation which represents all similar routes with a
single network (using [network class's default route](202206280922.md)# but
smaller subnet mask is possible) if the routes share a single exit interface.

In #[Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md), this could be
done using the command `ip route` and supply it with the destination network
address, its subnet mask and the next-hop router's IP address or the outgoing
interface (called exit interface). Since using next-hop router's IP address for
static route could result in [Recursive Route Lookup](202211051047.md)#, it is
advised to use exit interface when ever possible. However, in the case of
configuring on an [Ethernet](202207051550.md)# link, the best practice is to
configure with both the next-hop router's IP address and the exit interface to
avoid [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](202209301002.md)# shenanigans.

**Note**: Static route cannot be modified in Cisco. We need to remove it
manually using the `no` command and write a new static route.

If the static routes cannot be resolved, the router will simply remove all the
routes from the routing table.
