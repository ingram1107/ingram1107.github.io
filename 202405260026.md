# Soft-Timer Handling Facility

[Soft-Timer](202405251401.md) handling facility allows starting or stopping a
timer and maintains the application [Timers](202404061106.md) internally. One of
its two components lives in the [timer tick ISR](202405260021.md) and another in
the context of a [Process](202210062301.md).

There would be a dedicated worker task that works together with [system timer ISR](202405260021.md).
The timer chip is programmed with a particular [Interrupt Rate](202405251419.md)
which results in much smaller granularity than [Soft Timer](202405251401.md).
The facility keeps track of the countdown value and decrements it by one during
each timer interrupt invocation, then notifies the worker after the countdown
value reaches zero which allows the process to be scheduled for execution.
Finally, it reinitialises the countdown value back to the original value.
