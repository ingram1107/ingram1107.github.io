# Soft-Timer Handling Facility

[Soft-Timer](202405251401.md) handling facility allows starting or stopping a
timer and maintains the application [Timers](202404061106.md) internally. One of
its two components lives in the [timer tick ISR](202405260021.md) and another in
the context of a [Process](202210062301.md).
