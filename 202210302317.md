# Kasiski Method

Kasiski Method is a #[Cryptanalytic Attack](202209281257.md), developed by
Baddage and Kasiski, attempts to break #[Polyalphabetic Cipher](202210292209.md)
by deducing the length of the keyword. The repetition in the ciphertext,
especially in [Vigen√®re Cipher](202210302259.md) gives clues to the key length
by examining the period apart between multiple identical ciphertext patterns and
find out the common [factor](202210092143.md)# of the distances (excluding 1 as
a possible key length). After that, we could easily do a [Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)
on the ciphertext.
