# Scatternet

Scatternet is one of the [Bluetooth](202304212236.md) network topologies which
consists of multiple [Piconets](202304220122.md). Note that a device can only be
the hive of one piconet at a time, but may serve as drones in other piconets.
This addresses the issue of piconet overlapping that has different hopping
sequences where the collisions may occur due to same carrier frequency.
