# X Core Font

X Core Font is a #[202205051728](202205051728.md) system that was traditionally used in
#[202205051624](202205051624.md). One could add the path to installed fonts by modify the
[configuration file](202205051716.md):

```
Section "FontPath"
  Files "path/to/installed/fonts/
EndSection
```

For [202205051735](202205051735.md)#, two commands could be used to generate usable font in
X11. `mkfontscale` will create a `font.scale` file for outline fonts.
`mkfontdir` will combine the generated `font.scale` to `font.dir` where X11 can
detect them.

There are several shortcomings of using X Core Font. One of them is that it is
not easy to integrate the screen display and printed output. Second, since it is
a server based implementation, local applications aren't able to access the
fonts directly. There is limited support for kerning (adjustment of spaces
between characters) and other advance typographic features in using X Core Font,
plus it doesn't support font smoothing (convert [202205051735](202205051735.md)# to
[202205051731](202205051731.md)#).

Modern [202204081225](202204081225.md) distribution has replaced X Core Font with
[202205052008](202205052008.md)#.
