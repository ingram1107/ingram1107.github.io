# Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)

IS-IS is a #[classless](202210152246.md) #[Link-State Routing Protocol](202207070959.md)
which has wide adoption by [Internet Service Provider (ISP)](202209271141.md)#.
It is a rather harden protocol to used as the attacker couldn't break into a
network routing with IS-IS using other [Routing Protocol](202207061815.md). It
is available for both [IPv4](202206151453.md)# and [IPv6](202206281129.md)#.
