# Computer Architecture

There are several considerations when trying to solve main memory bottlenecks,
including [RAM hardware design](202403132022.md), memory controller designs,
[CPU Caches](202403191017.md), and [Direct Memory Access (DMA)](202403151658.md)
for devices.


Traditionally, there are three implementations of computer architecture:
- **Classic structure with Northbridge and Southbridge**
- **Classic structure with extra memory controller extensions**
- **Integrated Memory Controller**.

In the classic structure with Northbridge and Southbridge, CPUs share the front
side bus (FSB) to connect to the Northbridge. The RAM is connected to the
Northbridge with memory controller. Other I/O devices are connected to
Southbridge through variety of buses instead, thus the name *I/O bridge*. After
the expansion of RAM buses or channels especially after the introduction of
[DDR2](202403150636.md), Northbridge is responsible for interleaving memory
access across channels. The following picture shows such classic structure:

**Note**: It seems like FSB is obsolete and has been replaced by QuickPath
Interconnect (QPI) and Ultra Path Interconnect (UPI), where the latter two are
deployed in NUMA system explained later.

Another architecture design choice is to have multiple external memory
controllers. This design, shown below, is only limited by Northbridge internal
bandwidth.

We can have integrated memory controller, where individual CPU and RAM are
coupled as a pair in a unit of **node**. CPUs are still interconnects with each
other and memory access to other RAMs withheld by other CPUs, through
interconnects, is deemed necessary for economic reason. This system is often
called Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) system, and its overall concept is shown
as below:

**Note**: In 64 byte cache line, lower 6 bits are zeroed.

Machines with **more than four** processors must be built different due to
working set size effect on the [Cache](202403191017.md) performance.
