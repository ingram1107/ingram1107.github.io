# Enterprise Integration File Transfer

File transfer is a kind of [Enterprise Integration](202305011106.md) that have
each application produce files that contain the information that must be shared
with other applications. Integrators take the responsibility of converting the
file formats, that must be agreeable file name convention and directories, to be
compatible to application needs. It is preferred to have fresh file, so that it
doesn't create a situation in which the application may be out of sync. If that
is not the case, [Enterprise Integration Messaging](202305011126.md) is a better
alternative. Be aware of [Producer-Consumer Problem](202201301240.md),
housekeeping (who is responsible to keep and delete the files), and locking
mechanism ([POSIX Advisory Lock](202210262204.md), [POSIX Mandatory Lock](202210262144.md))
to prevent possible arisen synchronisation problems.

Prefer file transfer enterprise integration if the data is huge and doesn't need
to be updated frequently.
