# Bridge

Bridge is a #[202207051821](202207051821.md) operates at
[202206131651](202206131651.md)# which provides the ability to split the
#[202207051805](202207051805.md) into smaller ones, controls data flow, handles
transmission error and enables access to physical device.

It will learn all the addresses of the computers that connected to it and only
transfer the network traffic to the destination device or the network that
contains it. This can reduce the occurrence of the collisions and improve the
[Network Congestion](202209302043.md)#.

One could view it as a kind of firewall, as Bridge protects network segment from
the propagation of frame-level errors from other network segments.

It is also used as a solution to makes different
#[202207051554](202207051554.md) protocols compatible by implementing the
translational bridging (translating a packet from one LAN technology to
another).

Be aware that #[202207081644](202207081644.md) could happen within the network.
