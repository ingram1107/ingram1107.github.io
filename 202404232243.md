# Pre-Runtime Scheduling

Handcrafting a schedule offline is possible if the [System](202303242148.md) is
expected to do simple things. Pre-runtime scheduling guarantees the execution of
order of the [Process](202210062301.md) and is able to prevent conflicting
access to shared resources. Another benefit to it is that the programmer is
capable to reduce the cost of [Context Switching](202404141543.md).
