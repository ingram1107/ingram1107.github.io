# Computer Virus

Computer Virus is a self-replicable malware that could spread throughout the
infected system by injecting itself into a legitimate program or file. It
typically consists of three components: infection mechanism, payloads (harmful
content), and triggers.

The lifetime of a Virus typically involves four phases:
1. Dormant phase (some may not have this phase to begin with)
2. Propagation phase (self-replication)
3. Triggering phase
4. Execution phase (execute the payload)

Common types of virus are:
- Parasitic Virus (attached to a file)
- Memory-resident Virus ([Fileless Virus](202211181709.md)# reside in memory)
- Boot Sector Virus ([Fileless Virus](202211181709.md)# reside in boot sector)
- Stealth Virus (run under antivirus radar)
- Polymorphic Virus (mutate when spreading to a new host)
- Metamorphic Virus (mutate with new infection which rewrites itself completely)

It can be detected by spread detection and analyse detection. To bypass such
detections, Virus can utilise several obfuscation techniques such as
*encryption*, *act benign* (using Trojan Horse as a shell), *lay dormant*, or
simply *infect slowly*. The payloads of the virus could be different every time
it spread to a new victim, which will confuse the antivirus even more. Virus
usually doesn't output anything to avoid alerting the user that execute it.

**Note**: Generally, don't execute programs from unknown sources will prevent
most of the virus from spreading.

When programming a Virus, make use of comment markers to identify the start and
the end of a payload.
