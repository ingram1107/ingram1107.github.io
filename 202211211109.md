# Computer Virus

Computer Virus is a self-replicable malware that could spread throughout the
infected system by injecting itself into a legitimate program or file. It
typically consists of three components: infection mechanism, payloads, and
triggers.

It can be detected by spread detection and analyse detection. To bypass such
detections, Virus can utilise several obfuscation techniques such as
*encryption*, *act benign* (using Trojan Horse as a shell), *lay dormant*, or
simply *infect slowly*. The payloads of the virus could be different every time
it spread to a new victim, which will confuse the antivirus even more. Virus
usually doesn't output anything to avoid alerting the user that execute it.

When programming a Virus, make use of comment markers to identify the start and
the end of a payload.
