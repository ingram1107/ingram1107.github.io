# EtherChannel

EtherChannel is a port link aggregation technology could be used on
[Switches](202207051907.md)# and [Routers](202207061800.md)#. If one of the
ports configured as part of an EtherChannel are at fault, it will not bring the
whole operation down (fault-tolerant). Instead, all the ports are act as one
interface. EtherChannel can carry up to 8 interfaces per EtherChannel. It
supports there kind of configuration method: static, PAgP, and LACP, where the
latter two are for dynamic configuration. To enable it on Cisco devices, we
can run `channel-group {group-number} mode {mode}` on the interfaces where we
want the EtherChannel to be on where the group number is not necessarily need to
be the same for matching devices. The following table shows the mode available
and which protocol it will activate.

| Protocol/Static | Device 1  | Device 2  |
| ---             | ---       | ---       |
| Static          | On        | On        |
| PAgP            | Desirable | Desirable |
| PAgP            | Desirable | Auto      |
| LACP            | Active    | Active    |
| LACP            | Active    | Passive   |

**Note**: Both Auto and Passive mode for EtherChannel will activate the
corresponding protocol only if the connected device actives the protocol.
