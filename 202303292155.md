# IEEE 802.11

802.11, also known as Wireless Ethernet or Wi-Fi, defines the
[IEEE](202210010828.md) standards for [Wireless LAN (WLAN)](202302161710.md) in
[MAC layer](202206151451.md) and [Physical Layer](202206131647.md). It includes
802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ad, and 802.11ax. It
utilises Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSS) for wireless
[Multiplexing](202209091259.md). 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n are compatible
standards that can use up to 14 overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz band, in
which 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping. 802.11a is, however, incompatible to the
mentioned standards as it uses 12 non-overlapping channels for indoor use in the
5 GHz band, and allows additional channels designed for outdoor use. The
following table shows each standard operation frequency, typical bandwidth,
maximum bandwidth, indoor range, and outdoor range:

| IEEE standard | Operation Frequency | Typical Bandwidth | Maximum Bandwidth | Indoor Range | Outdoor Range | Frequency Selection                                                      | Typical Transmit Power |
| ---           | ---                 | ---               | ---               | ---          | ---           | ---                                                                      | ---                    |

There are two types of configuration can be adopted in IEEE 802.11: independent
configuration and infrastructure configuration. Independent configuration
involves a [basic service set (BSS)](202304171335.md) and deploys an ad hoc
network which allows direct communication but with limited coverage area.
Infrastructure configuration instead has several [Access Points (AP)](202304061549.md)
and BSSs where the stations select one AP to associate with. The traffic will
flow through the AP. The extension of the wireless coverage area is done by
[distribution system (DS)](202304171340.md), establishing an [extended service set (ESS)](202304171342.md).

Joining a 802.11 network is done through three stage: **scanning**,
**[Authentication](202210040915.md)**, and **association or reassociation**.
Scanning (single or multichannel) could be done actively using probe request
(active network discovery) or passive with beacon frame (client listen and
capture from AP). It requires the function to find and join a network, find a
new AP while [Roaming](202303021542.md), and initialise an independent BSS or ad
hoc network. Authentication can be done by [shared key](202303021603.md) and/or
[open system](202303021606.md). For securing against
[Intruder](202301021642.md), [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](202303081739.md)
can be used.

Like [Ethernet](202207051550.md), IEEE 802.11 also adopts CSMA but
[avoiding collision](202304262143.md) at all.

There are also product compatibility standards from IEEE 802.11 for
[WPAN](202303292149.md).
