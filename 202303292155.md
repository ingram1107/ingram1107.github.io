# IEEE 802.11

802.11, also known as Wireless Ethernet or Wi-Fi, defines the
[IEEE](202210010828.md) standards of 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n,
802.11ac, and 802.11ax. It utilies Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSS) for
wireless [Multiplexing](202209091259.md). 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n are
compatible standards that can use up to 14 overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz
band, in which 1, 6, and 11 are non-overlapping. 802.11a is, however,
incompatible to the mentioned standards as it uses 12 non-overlapping channels
for indoor use in the 5 GHz band, and allows additional channels designed for
outdoor use.

WLAN can be secured by [802.1x/EAP-FAST authentication](202303021603.md) and
[WPA2](202303021606.md) encryption. For securing against
[Intruder](202301021642.md), [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](202303081739.md)
can be used.
