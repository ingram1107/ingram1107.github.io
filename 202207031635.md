# Law of Demeter

The Law of Demeter introduced by
[Assuring Good Style for Object-Oriented Programs](lit/@Lieberherr1989.md)#
states that each method or function can send messages to their
*preferred-supplier objects*, that is, *argument objects*, *itself*, *objects
either created in the method or in global scope*, and *the immediate subpart of
self* such as elements or object instantiated within the class. This also means
that they should call only methods belonging to *itself*, *parameters passed
into the method* (`class` type object), *objects created within the method or
its class*. [The Pragmatic Programmer](lit/@Hunt1999.md)

By obeying the law, the code base would be easier to maintain and comprehend as
the dependencies between classes are lesser and better organised.
