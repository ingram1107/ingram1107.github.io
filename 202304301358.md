# System Integration Life Cycle

System integration life cycle is like [System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](202303251030.md)
that is similar to [Waterfall Development Model](202304091717.md). It has seven
phases where each phase involves [issue identification](202305011153.md),
[formulation](202305011157.md), and [resolution](202305011201.md):
1. Requirements definition and specification: defines
   [Requirements](202303251303.md) by use, reviews requirements to resolve
   ambiguity, conflict etc., and develop system specifications to completely
   define and correctly interpret the [client's need](202303251328.md). It is
   the best if we can have the requirements of both systems, new and legacy, to
   be integrated in order to make the whole integration easier.
2. Feasibility analysis: determines how likely would the system be successfully
   developed and deployed, examines new technologies, and assesses the risk
   (functional and non-functional risks) then develops risk strategies
   accordingly. The result is a complete and consistent system performance
   criteria for feasibility and potential risk assessment. It must be developed
   in a functional basis, so that [Audit Trail](202304302032.md) can lead from
   [functional performance requirements](202303251345.md) of the client to the
   final development choice.
3. System architecture development: describes functional [System Architecture](202303242154.md),
   and specifies required technical capabilities like how the system should be
   integrated.
4. Management plan: identifies technical architecture alternatives, specifies
   required #configuration categories, prepares program and project plans like
   [Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)](202303251021.md), subcontractor management
   plan, and risk management plan.
5. System design: prepares logical and physical design (like [UML diagram](202304011211.md))
   and selecting design approaches ([top-down](202305011207.md),
   [bottom-up](202305011208.md), hybrid etc.) with the of computer assisted
   systems engineering (CASE) and other automated tools. During this phase, we
   have to meet the performance criteria established before by defining and
   exploring all design options.
6. Implementation including design implementation identifies technical
   configuration, specifies required configuration component items,
   [procurement](202304161643.md) from subcontractors, perform [system
   tests](202206201330.md), and deploys system.
7. Evaluation: reviews and evaluates system functions, obtains, installs, tests,
   and accepts modified components, maintains, modifies, augments, and enhances
   systems, and plans for system retirement or replacement.
