# Introduction

The author focused on the event happened in December 2013 where the residents of
San Francisco's Mission District blocks the way of the Google buses with their
flesh in protest of their effect on the rising cost of living and gentrification
in the district. Later on, these protests escalated into throwing rocks at these
private mean of transportation. These vehicles provided exclusively to Google
employees, though help to reduce the carbon footprints up to 2900 metric tons of
CO2 of the neighbourhood, used the publicly funded bus stops to pick up their
employees. The rent of the house around the bus stops rose as high as 20% as a
result of this, forcing out long-time residents and small business owner.

He defended the employees of the Google as they were usually overwork,
stressed-out, constantly monitored due to poorly executed Scrum project
management where sprints are treated as deadlines. According to
[Vivian Giang][giang2013], average Google employee leaves within a year to
either accept better positions outside Google or simply resigned. Sitting on
those air-conditioned buses on their way to work were their precious time to
relax themselves.

The direct cause of the resentments from the residents were coming from the
uneven distribution of wealth and benefits between the community and the tech
corporates. While Google made boxes in the stock market, the Mission District's
residents were uttering destroyed by the rent hikes. Not even the high-salary
Google employee can escape the worrying of their retirement saving, as US
doesn't have a functional social safety net.

The author pointed out that the root cause for this discontent is the mindset of
wishing an ever-growing economy, or "grow or die" after the widespread adoption
of web technology. Google's investors, officers or economic elites understand
that long-term goal is not necessarily achievable by short-term growth targets.
However, they are taught to oblige to the shareholders of their companies, as
the law told them to, regardless of how ridiculous the demands and pressures
from them might be. And even the shareholders are not necessarily evil by
themselves: they are holding the stocks and hoping them to go up or selling them
if they don't, all by using their own savings to support their retirement plans.

And it is a systemic problem that could have catastrophic effects. Classical
economists and business experts believe that growth is part of the nature of
digital economy while refuse to review the human part of the formulation.
Instead of perpetuating this belief, the author advocated a reform of the
economic system, shifting to a more distributed mode of value creation and
exchange, that values people more than growth itself. He claimed that it was the
vision back when the Internet was newly created, only to be hijacked by
libertarian economists in order to revive the declining securities markets and
restore market faith.

The system creates an illusion of possible success of becoming millionaires. The
Wall Street Journal introduced these "paper" billionaires, whose worth is
measured in stock instead of profits. A high-valued Internet enterprises on the
stock market doesn't mean they have the equitable profitability. The people who
are considered success, often just sell their stocks and turn them into real
estates or money. Corporates are willing to change the rule in any field but the
financial one, as they hugely benefited or wanted to be benefited from the
system. And the further those companies sell their stocks to the markets, the
more [centralise](../202203051018.md)# the financial capital is. Once the money
was bet in the stock market, it tends to sit there indefinitely.

# Chapter One: Removing Humans From The Equation

## Digital Industrialism

The author noticed that the computer or program is replacing human including
those are required to interact with customers. From the corporate view of point,
it is to reduce the cost of hiring a human including salaries, health benefits,
workplace condition, legal issues etc. However, having a computer to do job
doesn't necessarily translate to increasing in productivity, where the customers
are now require to do all the jobs what the previous human employee should do,
and subjected to potential program errors and network issues. The costs don't go
away, he argued, and instead passes on to its customers, suppliers, and vendors
which will eventually bite back to the corporate itself due to reduced sales
volume, higher costs, and less feedback.

We shouldn't blame the computer technology as alienated the interaction between
customers and businesses, he said, and instead focused on the fundamental cause,
that is the digitally charged business model. The model stresses the efficiency
and growth of companies at the expense of the customers. The author reminded the
corporates that doing business is about create ongoing value for customers,
employees, and owners.

The author envisioned a revival of craftsmanships and artisanal production since
digital landscape is supposed to encourage production from the periphery,
lateral trade, and the distribution of wealth. To do so, a radical change need
to be done to revise the current business process and the purpose of technology.

## Mass Mass Mass

Competition is not always a good solution for market growth. In fact, there is a
counterexample brought up by Rushkoff: bazaar, a #p2p commerce framework
introduced from Middle-East communities, which brought substantial growth to
Late Middle Age in Europe. Such framework builds the business more with human
relationships and reputations instead of profits. As the sellers relying on
others for self-sufficiency, there is little intends to sell bad products to
their customers as it could hurt their reputation in the bazaar and in turn risk
buying a bad product needed in the future. Though such system will plant a seed
of cronyism as it favours the children of the existing members, there will be a
standardisation of prices, the training of apprentices, and the exchange of best
practices instead of competition among members.

The introduction of the bazaar gave rise to the merchant class where they gained
benefits from this new kind of economic model. In the meantime, the aristocracy
tried to usurp the wealth from the merchant class via force or political means
as they were losing their wealth, by taxing, guilds busting, outlawed local
currencies or bestowed monopoly charter to trusted merchant family. The #p2p
economy were reappropriated to suit the need of the aristocracy, which
transformed them into capitalists in this new top-down economic system:
industrialism.

The #p2p nature of the market is no more. Now the craftspeople had to seek
employment to a centralised monopoly charter instead of starting their own
business. Instead of selling wares they created, they were now selling their
labours and hours. However, remember the goal of industrialism system is not to
create growth, it is to extract wealth for individuals. Thus, it's more
intuitive for capitalists to suppress the wage of labours by seeking out
unskilled labour instead of a skilled one since the latter were entitled to
higher payment according to their expertise. Plus, with cheap labours, they can
leverage little political powers over possible abuses as they could be easily
replaced.

Industrialisation and technology advancements made using unskilled labours
doable. Alienating labourers from the whole process of value creation, and
instead teach them to do tiny part of the process repeatedly and efficiently,
the productivity seems to increase dramatically. However, the real costs of the
production are externalised to other entities with the form of rail and/or road
maintenance, environmental stresses etc. The subsequent technology advancements
aimed to minimise human interactions as much as possible to create a dumbwaiter
effect which distance the producer and customer the reality of the
industrialism: unethical labour practices, slave labours, pollutants that
destroy rich farming soil and so on.

To compensate the loss of connections between the workers and the customers,
branding or marketing are used to build the customer relationship with the
corporate. The marketer forges whatever mythology, which has little or nothing
to do with the product or its manufacture, into the brand label or icon. If
anything, it acts as a distraction from the reality of the factory, its
conditions, and its great distance away. With the help of the mass media, born
in the industrial age, they can propagate their brand mythologies beyond their
country boundaries.

These three Masses: mass production, mass marketing and mass media come with a
huge human prices. The devaluing of the human labour, the distancing between
customer and producers, and the atomisation or isolation of customers with each
other. After all, lonely individuals are more subdue to advertisements.

It is by designed, after all, it is the mission of industrialism to suppress the
rising middle class and its #p2p market system. Instead of encouraging the
creation of value from the bottom up, it is about preserving the passively
earned income of the dominant class. It is to remove human from the equation. We
don't consider human components when evaluating the economy using any
measurement. The growth of the businesses and economy start to undermine our own
prosperity, and growth-centric (in contrast to human-centric) mindset still
dominate our mind and planning. Instead of viewing digital technologies as a
base for a new economic framework, we view them as a tool to scale up
industrialism more. We've entered the digital age, but it's hardly different
from the ages before us.

## The Digital Marketplace: Winner Takes All

The advertisers siege the opportunity and commercialise the Internet and turn it
into a centralised strip mall instead of a true peer-to-peer marketplace. In
online commerce, the author argued, it's mostly a few companies selling to many,
and many people selling to the very few due to highly personalised
recommendation engines. Looking at the music industry as an example. Although a
website could host infinite music, in practice, only those popular can share the
spoils. Comparing to the days of physical albums where 80% of sales came from
the top 20%, on iTunes, bottom 94% sell fewer than 100 copies each. Instead of
working towards equity, Internet commerce exacerbates the gap. The author called
this as **power-law dynamics** as the statistics based on the data mentioned
will look like a steep slope upward. In other word, it is winner-takes-all
scenario.

The positive reinforcement from personal choice further encourage power-law
dynamics due to personialised recommendation engine which is essentially a
feedback loop. A hit on a film is better than no hit at all, because the former
will more likely get recommended to other people. This is what happen when human
is removed from the equation. Some said that this is all due to freedom of
choice. However, if we look deeper, they are an expression of one aspect of
human nature, amplified by machines at the expense of all the others.

Even if the corporate actively promotes the underdog in its platform, the effect
of current digital marketing dogma causes the user to be overwhelmed by options
that they won't be able to pick anything at all.

## The Economy of Likes

The development of the digital technologies grow so quick, that nothing
conventional value left from the customer can be extracted further. To maintain
the illution of growth, social media companies come out with the alternative:
use user engagements as the basis. Likes, views, reblogs, favourites etc. can be
valuable information for market targeting from advertisers, and social media
companies exploits this by making user engagement as the metrics instead of the
real financial value growth.

To avoid the inevitable drain of the engagements, the social media companies use
every methods to get our attention, time and data in order to sell them to
the big data market reserarch firms. This turns their customers into products.
Not only that their users are increasing pressured to make posts that adhere to
their corresponding bubbles, professional jobs are replaced by the metrics too.
Such dehumanisation could be seen in music industry where the albums sale is
less important that the media attention, especially degrading sensationalism,
and concert ticket sale to the celebrity.

> Nothing of value is created, but billions of dollars are made. (p. 37)

## The Big Data Play

The big data technology is able to predict one's future decision by just
comparing one data point or profile to everyone else data point or profile.
Though people are not concern about metadata of our operations such as when the
phone is called, its duration, the location, the places we went etc., these data
are as valuable as to the private data such as the phone content and emails to
the big data company. The more data point they have about you, the more accurate
they can construct your profile.

However, big data doesn't necessarily bring growth to the economy. It's still
based on one past actions to make a likely prediction. The trend taken by the
corporates are to replace research and development with big data, only to lose
their competitive edge to their competitors as their competitors are likely use
the same big data model.

## Sharing Economics: Getting Humans Back "On The Books"

Though Jaron Lanier suggested joining the system by price tagging every personal
information or property that we have, the author objected such view as it
dehumanise the human more. The sharing economy model is build on top of the
exploitation on the underpaid freelancers which otherwise could be an unemployed
person and circumvention of heavy industry regulation. The final formula for
sharing economy is to automate everything, it is to remove human from the
equation. It is not the fact that technology is replacing the human, it is the
nature of capital to remove the human from employment to reduce risk and
gain profits.

## The Unemployment Solution

We shouldn't fear about unemployement. In fact, it is better that we embrace it
as the digital technologies allow us to have more leisure times. What we produce
have already surplus our need, in a way that government and other authorities
need to destroy those productivity in order to stablise the price of goods. Now,
capitalists invented several things and market them as if they are useful where
in fact they are not so that economy growth can continue albeit it is, in truth,
a bubble. It also tries to justify the continuing wage labour practice to keep
the workers in believing that they are selling their time for something
valuable.

To solve the unemployement issue, Rushkoff suggested that:
1. Reduce work hour so that it leads to better economy, more free time, slower
   pace, less carbon footprint, better mental health, and more community
   engagement.
2. Share productivity gains with workers instead of outphasing them in
   corporate.
3. Guarantee minimum income to guarantee a life of dignity, that is to have
   adequate diet, housing, health services, and educational opportunity.
4. Provide public jobs, according to worker's abilities, to redirect labour to
   work on areas that need attention especially those that focus on value
   creation.

The third solution may disincentivises worker from working longer work hours,
but the difference made to the labour market is hardly significant.

The author said that digital society is digital in the sense that we don't shy
away from reprogram the previous assumption that we made in the industrial age.
Instead, we strive to change the economy from the ground up in benefits of
constructing human well-being. We should phase out the thinking of value
extraction that depends on resource scarcity, and instead opt in the thinking
value creation depends on productivity increase.

# Chapter Two: The Growth Trap

## Corporations Are Programs

Corporates are expected to grow indefinitely when in reality, they should
instead adapt to their surrounding, and act accordingly for their own survival.
By asking the following four question, we can know the purpose of coprorations:
1. What does the medium enhance or amplify?
2. What does the medium make obsolete?
3. What does the medium retrieve that had been obsoleted earlier?
4. What does the medium "flip into " when pushed to the extreme?

The corporation amplifies the power of the shareholders and the primacy of their
capital. This is due to the main purpose of the corporations in preserve the
aristocracies' wealth and social position by investing into the enterprise. The
corporations make the local bazaar and their peer-to-peer value creation nature
obsolete which also kill the incentive for innovations due to their monopoly
nature. The only job for a corporation left is to extract value, which means
there is no need for value exchange between parties. The result is
[Imperialism](../202203051018.md), outlawing any form of value creation that is
not under their control. Quite ironically, when a corporation is pushed to the
extreme, it flips into a person. It entitles the rights that a normal person
should have in order to benefit its investors. This means that corporation
desires the right of personhood even though it works to remove human from the
equation all the time.

Growth by extracting is not sustainable. Once resources are drained, the
corporation needs to move on to other places for value to be extracted for it
might result in war or resistance. It favours expansion, but never
consolidation, as it believes there is always new territories to be acquired.

When it is harder to make money via value creation, earning from capitals is
more favourable, which is the long term damage the economy growth. This is the
reason country with high Gini coefficient tends to perform poorly in economic
growth.

## The Platform Monopoly

There is a theory called creative destruction, in which a small startup with
superior technologies will replace the old obsolete corporates with the cost of
destroying traditional jobs and other companies, and take all of its
predecessor's market share in a more complete way. In other words, it's about
replacing a monopoly with a new monopoly. Traditional corporates may need
government intervention to achieve monopoly by suppressing weaker competitors
through legislation, but with digital advancement, the new competitors use
algorithms as their trump card instead.

Example like Uber place itself as merely a platform for car sharing, in which it
outsources its liabilities to individual drivers. This allows Uber to not serve
the public good, and instead place the market price as it pleases. To achieve
complete monopoly, being a mere car sharing is not enough; it needs to have
absolute control on the entire transportation sector. Such phenomenon is termed
platform monopoly by the author.

However, monopolies are not good for the economy. Their valuation will
eventually erodes as there are nothing left to extract from.

## Recoding the Corporation

Instead of building up centralised platform, a decentralised, peer-to-peer
alternative should be considered. Sidecar, a car-sharing company, provides a new
way to do the business. Instead of price-fixing like Uber do, it asks drivers to
set their own prices by negotiating with riders. Additionally, the rider might
choose the same driver if they find their service to be satisfactory. The
valuation of their company doesn't seem great, but growth is not a requirement
for them. It is merely a side effect of doing a good business.

## The Steady-State Enterprise

A major technological revolution will go through five phases: *maturity* where
the established companies from previous technological revolution plant seeds for
new innovations, *irruption* where technological breakthrough happened and
disruption of the previous technology and the industry that built around it,
*turning point* when the economy become extremely unequal and forces government
to intervene, then *synergy* in which the original technological revolution
have wider adoption and become more accessible.

Since neither populists from either political spectrum advocated for government
intervention, in which the right populists blamed economic recession on
government and left populists focus on mutual-aid, the author advocated that
CEOs should intervene the economy by themselves with the following advices:
1. Abandoned prioritising growth, but sustainability of business, and if
   necessary, scale down the business in face of crisis.
2. Adopt a hybrid strategy that retain some proprietary practices while open for
   collaborations with expertises in other field.
3. Convince the shareholders to prioritise corporate long-term interests or
   distribute the shares among the employees. Sometimes, going private is a
   viable option to get rid of stubborn shareholders.
4. Going to not-for-profit model and retains the revenue solely for business
   purposes.

# Chapter Tree: Speed of Money

## Coin of The Realm

The author criticised the education system especially the economy academia as it
trains economists to only think in the framework of corporate capitalism. He
thinks that corporate capitalism is less than ideal, and is naturally extractive
based on borrowed money, that is the capital. It is because of the capital, it
gives the participants the illusion that the economy is growing, where in fact
it is just the money being borrowed and resulting in more borrowing from the
market.

The book examined the origin of the capital. First, the precious metal (minted
coin) were used by the merchants for trading and bartering for less wealthy
locals. Because of the limitation of bartering, the merchants invented local
currencies based on receipt, that is a paper or metal foil stamped with a market
value, which can be used for value exchange. Any merchant can issue such
receipts as long as they had enough trust (stable sales) from the locals. The
extra receipts received could later be paid back in metal coin or saved for the
next market day. Such currency were aimed to promote transactions in the market
for everyone's prosperity instead of selfish wealth hoarding for oneself since
the value of the receipt could deplete over time when the merchant printed more
of them. However, such decentralised nature of local currencies were frowned
upon by the despotic nobles and monarchs. Instead of joining such system, the
monarchs instead monopolised the money by creating central currency from their
treasury and forbidding the minting of local currencies. It is aimed to slow
down the economy activities to suppress the growth of the middle class and gives
the ruling class the absolute control over the economy with violent instruments
securing their grip.

Essentially, the monarchs or ruling class can simply tax the people by debasing
the central currency in order to keep their extra gold and silver. If any
merchant need money for business, they have to borrow money from a central
entity tie with interest, which in itself is extractive to make more money for
the central entity. Furthermore, this form of currency is tied to the
participant's credit instead of the demand for goods in the market unlike the
local currencies. This resulted in encouraging the hoarding of money as the
people fear of effect of currency debasing and the ever-increasing heat from
competition instead of cooperation between merchants. Corporate capitalism grows
the synthetic economy of money itself in the form of credits, instead of the
value, that is the goods and services produced by the market. Thus, we often see
corporates compete to become the issuer, to be at the financial centre to
have control over the currency. Thus, they desire to expand of the market to
seek more value to exploit, gave birth to colonialism and expansionist policies.

This is reason why the creditor nations demand the debtor nations to implement
austerity policies (in the example of Eurozone) instead of initiating easing
policy or lowering interest rate. The aimed of the system is to extract money
from the debtor, not to save the debtor in the wishing of generating and
exchanging value in the market. It's why central bank is reluctant to lend money
to the people by lowering interest rate or quantitative easing (buying bank's
stashes of bonds), and instead, invests on financial instruments or stock of
companies. The only way to save the economy, is by government intervention,
which is by pathetically borrow money from the central bank to pay the people in
order to put the money back into the market, and later pay back the loans in the
future.

**Note**: Though convincing, the explanation is self-contradictory from the
historical evidence. If monarchs controlled the financial instrument to
establish central currency, how did Middle Ages countries like France ended up
bankrupt? Was the merchants somehow usurp the power from the despotic rulers? If
so, how did they do that? #pennote

## Reprogramming Money - Bank Vaults to Blockchains

Some would argue that returning to gold-based currency could fix the problem as
it fixed the value of the money. But the main issue about gold-based currency is
of its scarcity, which encourages money hoarding. Instead, we should focus on
increasing the velocity (exchange) of the currency, that is how quick a
transaction can circulate money in the market. PayPal did bring convenience and
speed to the currency for peer-to-peer transactions. However, it later caved in
to the pressure from central banks and large financial institutions, and started
to charge credits from the transactions. One is down.

Then one day, Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology, came out
to bypass any central authority for peer-to-peer transaction. Each transaction
is verified by the peers in the network, which then the peers will be rewarded
with bitcoins (called mining), and there is no credit charged. It seems all fine
until we realise that Bitcoin has a limit threshold of how many bitcoins can be
circulated in the network. It was then plagued by investors to skyrocket its
exchange rate for potential profits. Like gold, Bitcoin failed because of its
nature of scarcity, not mentioning the cost of the computer processing and
electricity for cryptocurrency mining, two of the resources that can easily
rented by other entities.

Though blockchain failed to become the utility for monetary use, other entities
started to utilise the technology for other purposes like decentralised
autonomous corporations (DAC). Instead of relying on board of directors or CEOs,
the governing rules and mission emerge from consensus between the members, with
the aid of blockchain ledger. The corporate operations are open and transparent,
and awards contribution with appropriate stock to the employees. The growth of
DAC is based on the number of projects developed by the members, thus guarantee
value creation. Despite its majestic nature, it still suffers from inequitable
distribution, in which the newcomers are put in a more disadvantage position
than the old employees. This is due to the nature that **decentralism doesn't
promise equitable distribution**, just a different kind of exchange and
verification system.

## Money is a Verb

The author argued that the solution doesn't need to come from technology, and in
fact, doesn't require much technological advances. We trust blockchain not
because we trust each other, but because we trust the technology. It's still not
initiating desired social bonds and mutual benefits, in which shapes an
alienated atomic economic culture, not a peer-to-peer one. Instead of
reinventing existing money system like Bitcoin did, we should fit the money into
the human behaviours, make it a mere exchange tool which its purpose is to
encourage peer-to-peer value exchanges instead of hoarding. He suggested the
following:

1. Use or invent local currency based on geographical vicinity like BerkShare,
   Detroit Dollars, Santa Barbara Missions, Bristol, Brixton, and Cumbrian
   Pounds.
2. Local currency must peg to nothing but itself, independent of existing money
   systems, that encourages frequent transactions by depleting value or only
   redeemable when reach a transaction limit.
3. Use labour, favour (offer goods and services), or times as currency like
   favour bank and time dollars or banks (Fureai Kippu, Local Exchange Trading
   System (LETS)) to encourage cooperation.
4. Local bank provides authentication and financial expertise to small
   businesses, lend the money together with the community, and turning interests
   into local discount.

# Chapter Four: Investing Without Existing

## Finance is Nothing Personal

At first, the corporate-based pension system was targetted to increase its
profits instead of executing its responsibility to provide security to its
employees' future. Though the surplus of the investment from the fund of the
pension goes into the pocket of shareholders and the executives, they are
reluctant to compensate the loss of the pension system in the expanse of the
corporate. Some circumvents it by reducing the pension for the junior employees
and dividing the union from within. Some corporates even use the pension system
as an emergency ban account to assist the corporate operations and risky
investment.

During the Reagan era, the financial liability of the corporates was delegated
to the individual employee in order to further cut cost of the corporate's
operation cost especially from the pension system. Instead, the employees are
expected to manage their financial future in their own hand with the illusion of
more information and control. In fact, they are being manipulated by the
financial advisors to retrieve commissions regardless of their performance since
the financial accounts are not disclosed by the financial instruments. Since
there are more customers in the market, the brokerage houses' profits are
increasing due the large volume of trading in the expanse of retail investors'
profitability.

## Do Algorithms Dream of Digital Derivatives?

Before the improvement of the trading protocols, high-frequency trading (HFT)
algorithms were able to make profits out of the market volatility by
purposefully withdrawing all its bids, flooding the quote and order systems with
fake trades, and "front-running" people's purchases (abusing delay between
different trading system). These algorithms were run by ultrafast computer that
were physically close to the stock exchange computers with high-speed networking
and only available to wealthy firms. It put the individual investors into
disadvantageous position.

Even after the improvement of trading protocols, the human are expected to abuse
the volatility of the market as it is an encouraged practice by many. Human
should act like an algorithm in the market. Thus, the market is no longer driven
by supply and demand, business conditions, or commodity prices, and instead
driven by prices, flows, and volatility determined by the feedback loop of the
algorithms. The stock market is less and less relevant to the reality that it
grounds.
