# Who are the Abandoned Generation

The Abandoned Generation (棄民世代, Kimin Sedai), defined by the author, is a
group of people born between 1971 and 1984 which suffered greatly due to the
burst of the Japanese Estate Price Bubble (バブル景気, Baburu Keiki or 平成景気,
Heisei Keiki) and the following Employment Ice Age (就職氷河期, Shuushoku
Hyougaki) which caused high unemployment nationwide in Japan. They are also
referred by the term Employment Ice Age Generation (就職氷河期世代, Shuushoku
Hyougaki Sedai) and Lost Generation (失われた世代, Ushinawareta Sedai).

# Their Situation

During the Employment Ice Age, the talent, and job search ratio dropped below
0.60, accompanied by a sharp rise of unemployment rate to higher than 5%. It
especially hit hard against young male employees as their unemployment rate
reached 11.6% which is the highest since 1968. This resulted in a drastic
increase of freeter (フリーター, Furita, describe a group of people especially
the youth who don't seek for a stable employment and instead work as a temporary
employee (on demand). The loosening of the Temporary Staffing Services Law
(労働者派遣法, Roudousha Dekenho) after the review in 1996 and 2004, especially
the loosing of manufacturing sector, meaning more corporates are able to hire
great proportion of temporary employees in order to reduce their manpower costs,
resulted in large amount of workers who otherwise qualified for a full time
employment, get employed as a temporary employee instead. From 1999 to 2019, the
percentage of temporary employees in the total female and male workforces had
increased from 39.8% to 56.2% and 11.1% to 22.4% respectively. Note on the
differences between the female and male statistics. Peculiarly, a great amount
of workers aged between 15 and 24 years old work as a temporary employee
regardless of their gender, which could be seen from the data provided by the
author (45.2% to 57.1% for female, 33.7% to 47.6% for male).

Now coming back to the differences between the female and male statistics. When
we see the overall picture of the workforce in Japan, there were 9.16 million
full-time employees and 3.15 million temporary employees among the Abandoned
Generation in 2008. The population barely changed for the full-time employees in
2018 (9.15 million), but the temporary employees had been increased to 3.71
million. The author found out that male workforces were able to obtain a
full-time job as their full-time employees' population increased and temporary
employees' population decreased in 2018. On the other side of the coin, female
workforces suffered a decrease of about 280 thousand of full-time employees and
an increase of about 930 thousand of temporary employees. It is speculated by
the author that it might due to the discriminatory hire strategy from the market
where women were expected to have maternity leave during their employment. Even
after the reform of Abenomics (安倍ノミクス, Abe No Mikusu), most of them
doesn't experience much wage raise and sometime even with worsen wage. Compare
to their Bubble Generation (バブル世代, Baburu Sedai) counterpart, they have an
average annual income difference of ¥400 to ¥800 thousand. Even when comparing
to their younger counterpart, Yutori Generation (ゆとり世代, Yutori Sedai),
their annual income is still lower. It is also a direct and indirect factor of
high amount of Hikikomori (引きこもり, or known as acute social withdrawal, is a
total withdrawal from society and seeking extreme degrees of social isolation
and confinement) and NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) population,
which increased from 300.5 thousand in 1997 to 390 thousand in 2018.

Not only does the aftermath of the burst of the Japanese Estate Price Bubble
affected the Abandoned Generation in their economic life, it also muddles their
marital status regardless of their gender. In 2005, 31.2% of men and 18.7% of
women aged between 35 and 39 years old, and 22.7% of men and 12.2% of women aged
between 40 and 44 years old were single. In 2015, however, the figure rose to
35% of men and 23.9% of women aged between 35 and 39 years old, and 30% of men
and 19.3% of women aged between 40 and 44 years old were single. An interesting
fact is that the total percentage of men and women who doesn't get married was
23.4% and 14.1% respectively. The older the demographics went, the closer is
the percentage of their marital status matches the percentage of people who
never married. It is likely, therefore, that older people are unlikely to get
marry once after they aged 30 years old.

And since there are a great proportion of people from the Abandoned Generation
work as self-employed or temporary staff. This resulted in a low payment from
National Pension (国民年金, Kokumin Nenkin), mandatory to all residents in Japan
aged between 20 and 60 years old, which is pushing these people into poor
economic condition. Even if they are officially employed by the corporate, since
their salary are often lower (compare to their peers), the payment from the
Employee's Pension Insurance (厚生年金, Kousei Nenkin) will also become lower
unless they were lucky to be employed as a full-time employee when they were
fresh graduates. Such phenomenon could be observed when we look closer to the
average annual income earned by workforce aged from 35 to 44 years old, where
those who employed as a full-time employee immediately as a fresh graduate enjoy
¥5.307 million, and those who later be converted from being a temporary employee
to full time employee has only a salary of ¥4.007 million. Notwithstanding the
fact that most of the Abandoned Generation that has a chance to sign in to
Employee's Pension Insurance doesn't sign for it continuously for 40 years. This
fact is important because from the optimistic projection from the Ministry of
Health, Labour and Welfare (厚生労働省, Kousei Roudou Shou) about income
replacement ratio was that it will decrease to 60.2% in 2024 (it was 61.7% in
2020), and plummeted to 50.8% in 2040 due to sub-replacement fertility. It is
with the assumption that the income replacement ratio is based on
40-year-sign-in of Employee's Pension Insurance, which mean it could be worse
for the Abandoned Generation.

**Note**: There is another way to have pension in Japan: corporate's own
annuities and retirement benefits policies.

The situation appeared to be even worse as we look closer to the National
Pension Insured Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
once every three years. We see two interesting facts. First, there are 31.8%
people aged between 20 and 34 years old who were overdue their payment for the
National Pension in 2005. The figure decreased to just 18.0% in 2019, and from
here we can see the immediate effect of the economic crisis at the time to the
Abandoned Generation. Second, the total amount of people aged between 35 and 49
years old who applied for full exemption from the pension payment was 970
thousand in 2019, which is a staggering increase from 610 thousand. This
indicates that the situation faced by Abandoned Generation not only doesn't get
improved overtime, but also worse compare to their older generation. The author
argued that it is due to the large amount of people who couldn't afford to pay
their pension payment when they were young since they faced quite a hard time in
employment.

In spite of the predicament the Abandoned Generation faced, the Japanese
government still pushing for increasing Good and Service Tax (GST) from 3% in
1989 to 10% 2019. Lobbyists are pressuring the government to aim for GST
increase to 19% in 2025, which is further supported by IMF for aiming 15% in
2030. However, GST taxes the essential goods that are needed by the low income
population, which is the majority of the Abandoned Generation reside in. Even if
it is for good reason, it is basically a weak support weak scheme that in itself
a negative reinforcement. A just tax structure should have the rich to support the
weak. However, the lobbyists that support for an increase in GST, in turn oppose
such increase in corporate tax, and opted for a decrease instead.

The increasing fee to subscribe National Health Insurance (国民健康保険, Kokumin
Kenko Hoken) due to ever increasing burdern from decreasing subsribers from
agricultural industry and self-employed owners and increasing subscribers from
seniors and temporary employees. The situation became evident as national
average medical fee increased from ¥2,911 in 2000 to ¥5,869 in 2018, which is
twice than in 2000. According to the 2018 survey, 28.6% Japanese from age 0 to
78 subsribed to the Insurance, where a sizable minority from the Abandoned
Generation (18.6% from age 35 to 39, 18.9% from age 40 to 44, and 20.0% from age
45 to 49) form part of the statistics despite the increasing burden. Despite the
fee increase, National Health Insurance still faces financial deficit. The
likely trend, predicted by the author, will be to increase the subscriber fee
which will deepen the predicament faced by the Abandoned Generation in their
difficult financial situation.

There is an estimation done in 2018 that 1.47 million people from Abandoned
Generation that have to apply for Public Assistance (生活保護, Seikatsu Hogo) in
order to satisfy their basic needs. Despite the fact, the Japanese government is
working to lower the support of Public Assistance, reducing food, accommodation,
fuel (winter related) subsidies, with addition of further budget reduction.

According to the projection by National Institute of Population and Social
Security Research (国立社会保証・人口問題研究所, Kokuritsu Shakai Hoshou Jinkou
Mondai KenkyuuJo), the percentage of the population that never married will be
30% for male and 20% for female in 2035, which might be the reality for the
Abandoned Generation in the near future where there will be no child for them to
burden their medical care. In another survey conducted in 2012 by Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Communications (総務省, Soumu Shou), there are 2,399,000
employees that also responsible for taking care of their parents. However, from
2007 to 2012, there are 487,000 employees were forced to resign in order to take
care for their parents, in which 80% of them are female. The mentioned
statistics are important as the Japanese structure of social welfare system
takes the assumption of there will be sufficient family care for the elderly.
Such system, criticised by the author, is obviously not based on the ground. The
birth population of Japan has been decreased from less than 1 million to less
than 900 thousand in 2019. The Abandoned Generation is in the critical situation
where they have to take the burden of family care while at the same time doesn't
have child to support their future senior life.

Not only does the Abandoned Generation suffered under disadvantageous economic
condition, but also mental issues. Based on the statistics gathered by
Federation of Inochi No Denwa (FIND, 日本いのちの電話連盟, Nihon Inochi No Denwa
Renmei), there were 167,820 or 23% of the total number of calls (725,857, where
367,199 are male, 358,658 are female) where individuals age around 30 (87,911 of
them are from male and 79,909 from female) called to the hotline seeking for
consultancy in 2008. 17,731 of them have suicidal tendency, which is 27% of the
total number of suicidal calls (64,488). After ten years (2018), these people,
now age around 40, made 23.7% of the total number of calls (627,475, where
309,565 are male, 317,910 are female) or 148,816 calls. And those who have
suicidal thoughts made 28.3% of the total number of suicidal call (68,398) or
18,373 calls. We can see that among the Abandoned Generation, they face serious
mental issues and stress as the statistics barely improved on them. Accompany by
poverty, they pose a potential source on increasing the crime rate in avenging
their unequal treatment and oppression in the society.

Among the people that lived in poverty, 19.4% of them are seniors, which is
higher than average compare to international community. The author predicts that
this percentage will reach 30% as the Abandoned Generation reaching the age.
Moreover, around 1.58 million people who were unmarried, 45- to 54-year-old, and
live with their parents in 2016 that were either unemployed, NEET, or contract
workers, 310 thousand of them were relying on their parents to maintain basic
needs. From age 35- to 44-year-old, there are 288 thousands people facing the
same issue. Worryingly, those same families have little financial resources to
take care of their children and facing great risk of bankruptcy.

There is a 2025 problem (２０２５年問題, 2025 Nen Mondai) triggered by baby
boomer generation (団塊の世代, Dankai no Sedai) in which the population ageing
becoming a serious issue to be handled by the Japanese government. In 2025, the
percentage of ageing people in Japan is predicted to be 30%. The ratio of people
aged 65 and above and people aged 15 to 64 will be 1.9, which means that around
two working people have to support one senior. In a survey done in 2017, the
total expenditure of Public Assistance (生活保護, Seikatsu Hogo) was ¥3.8
trillion. The author predicted that there will be a 2050 problem when the
Abandoned Generation aged. The percentage of ageing people will be 37.7% and the
ratio of people aged 65 and above and people aged 15 to 64 will be 1.4, which
means that around only one working people need to support one senior.
Expenditure of the Public Assistance will increase to ¥17.7 to 19.3 trillion
considering most of them doesn't have enough saving for retirement.

The trend of the gig economy around the globe may even worsen the economic and
mental situation of the Abandoned Generation as it doesn't guarantee employee
benefits and is forced to pack into a tight time constraint to deliver services.
There might be a chance for them to fight against the capital via collective
bargaining through unionisation, but the author is pessimistic about the
strength of the Japanese union as in 2019 the unionisation rate of Japan reached
only 16.7%.

# Solutions From the Government and Critics

From 2019 Basic Policies for Economic and Fiscal Management and Reform
(経済財政運営と構造改革に関する基本方針, Keizai Zaisei Un'ei to Kouzou Kaikaku
ni Kansuru Kihon Houshin) or "Big-Boned Policy" in short (骨太の方針, Honebuto
no Houshin), the government proposed the Employment Ice Age Generation Support
Program (就職氷河期世代支援プログラム, Shuushoku Hyougaki Sedai, Shien
Puroguramu) targeted at people aged from middle 30-year-old to 40-year-old,
which aimed to transform at least 300 thousand of them to full-time employee in
2020. This coupled with two strategies: first, the seamless support from
consultation, education and training, employment, to job stability;
second, humanised active support, instead of waiting passively, with wider
coverage in the form of social activity. Following the first policy, the
government sets up a special window in Public Employment Security Office
(公共職業安定所, Koukyou Shokugyou Anteisho) or Hello Work in English,
aided with speciality team that is responsible for employment
consultation, job introduction to job stability, provides 3 months
vocational training for the participants while they are working or at home
(with e-training), and pushes for halfway appointments for nation and local
civil servants in the next 3 years. Furthermore, Japanese government
incentivises the employment of such working population from corporates with
Specified Job Seeker Employment Development Subsidy (特定求職者雇用開発助成金,
Tokutei Kyuushokusha Koyou Kaihatsu Joseikin), a new section established in
Trial Employment Subsidy (トライアル雇用助成金, Toraiaru Koyou Joseikin),
subsidised ranged from ¥600,000 for Small and Medium Enterprise to ¥500,000 for
large enterprise.

Despite the efforts from the government, the author critised such policies are
deemed to fail as the solution is not based on the reality. The Temporary
Staffing Services Law passed by the parliament depresses the wages of contract
and full-time workers (those being marginalised), discourages the need of
corporates to transform them to proper full-time workers which inevitably
increases the cost of the human resources. This is further proven by the
decreasing applicants to the Trial Employment Subsidy, from 41,730 in 2014 to
23,609 in 2017, coupled with less than ideal execution efficiency (the ratio of
execution cost and allotted budget), from 30.8% in 2014 to 59.3% in 2017.
Ironically, most employees in Hello Work are in contract instead of full-time
due the decreasing budget to the department. There is also a concern about the
involuntary transformation of the employees to work in remote region they don't
like. Although there is Livelihood Welfare Fund Loan System
(生活福祉資金貸付制度, Seikatsu Fukushi Shikin Kashitsuke Seido) for low-income,
elderly, and disabled people, it is not ideal for maintaining daily expenditure
for people living in poverty, not mentioning its restrictive requirements
(individual yearly salary not exceeding ¥125,000) and eventual repayment.
Moreover, the term limit of Unemployment Insurance (失業保険, Shitsugyou Hoken)
fall short when comparing to European counterpart (90 to 360 days compares to 3
to 4 years).

The support program, pointed out by the author, is a perfunctory by the
government as its aim demographics had already passed their golden age for skill
learning. The Abandoned Generation is in the age of 40 and at their physical and
mental limit for further career development. Even if they could succeed in this
program, it's doubtful that they can have enough savings for their retirement as
they have only limited period to benefit from. In fact, the whole program is
another attempt by the government after the failed attempt of previous program,
Re-challenge (再チャレンジ, Sai Charenji), cancelled in 2009 as it was
ineffective.

Facing the ever decreasing birth rate, the ministries didn't come up with a good
solution to improve the parenting environment and lighten the burden of child
care. Instead, they often offended the women with their outdated patriarchal
thinking that shirk the responsibilities to the women and blame them for not
raising more children.

The LDP (Liberal Democratic Party, 自由民主党, Jiyuu Minshu tou) governments
were to blamed, the author claimed, for passive and sometimes even harmful role
in helping the Abandoned Generation. They are accused of following the advices
from business-dominated organisation, Japan Federation of Employers'
Associations (日本経営者団体連盟, Nihon Keieisha Dantai Renmei) to implement the
Temporary Staffing Services Law that encourage the use of temporary staffs
excluding the management. The first Prime Minister that pushed for this law was
Nakasone Yasuhiro, who single-handedly destroyed the JSP (Japan Socialist Party,
日本社会党, Nihon Shakai Tou) by privatising JNR (Japanese National Railways,
日本国有鉄道) to weaken the political influence of NRU (National Railway
Worker's Union, 国鉄労働組合, Kokutetsu Roudou Kumiai) and General Council of
Trade Unions of Japan (日本労働組合総評議会, Nihon Roudou Kumiai Souhyou Gikai)
which two of them eventually collapsed. The further loosening of the Temporary
Staffing Services Law initiated by the Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and his
Minister of State for Financial Services Heizou Takenaka, and the following
decreased of maximum of income tax rate and corporate tax rate, and budget
reduction from social security system worsen the situation of the Abandoned
Generation.

The author suggested instead of the half-effort policies like these, the
government should support the Abandoned Generation by fully paid re-education
and vocational training including tuition fee and necessary daily need. The
government should view the unemployed as reserve army for the newly grown
industry, and trains those adapt to the new environment, thus benefitting both
the employees and the economic growth. He also advocated of moving from relying
on corporates for social security and instead driving such system directly from
the government. Not only that, the social security system must be able to
accommodate the needs of the applicants, accompanied by the rehabilitation of
the Abandoned Generation. Furthermore, it is necessary to transform the
prejudice of the society from judging people that apply for social security and
welfare program and instead affirming their intrinsic value of human being. The
worker unions can also play an important role in providing physical and mental
support to those in need.

From a wider perspective, to prevent the Abandoned Generation from sinking into
more miserable circumstances, the government must guarantee a living wage (refer
to the real wage), reduce the tax or fee on daily necessities (telephone fee),
and support educational fees. It is crucial to guarantee a liveable minimum wage
throughout the country in order to save the regional economy by encouraging
consumerism. The mandatory expenditure for the companies especially the
transportation fees must be the responsibility of the corporate instead of
delegated to the employees. Instead of relying on scholarship, the university
tuition fee should be supported directly through the government budget. The
subsidies on tuition fee are necessary due to the deterioration of the public
education system. The government could further discourage the mistreatment of
the temporary employees by removing subsidies from those corporates which don't
follow such policy, thus forcing the companies to support their employees'
accommodation and family expenditure.

**Note**: In my opinion, the tuition fee shouldn't be the reform focus on
helping the Abandoned Generation. Instead, a more general reform on the public
education system should be initiated. Though in the meantime, it can be a
temporary solution.

Furthermore, the author proposed a sharing economy based on the locals' or
employees' needs. For example, they can share the rent of a single household
even though they are from different background as this will lighten the burden
and provide enough social support to each other. Such economy enables the
autonomous and democratic decision instead of dominated by corporate interests
(driven by profiteering). The locals or employees can establish a non-profit
worker cooperative with their funds that equally distribute the profits gained,
which means that there is not much wage disparity between management and
employees.

**Note**: The above idea is similarly of that to what suggested by
[Rushkoff](@Rushkoff2016.md).

# Interesting Facts

As the local employments that typically tie to local community where human
relationship are important (the residents as customers) fall, the surplus
labours (often temporary employees) are flooded in to fill up the need by the
community. However, because of their low wages, it ends up exaggerating the
poverty and/or mental health problem of the employees.
