The Abandoned Generation (棄民世代, Kimin Sedai), defined by the author, is a
group of people born between 1971 and 1984 which suffered greatly due to the
burst of the Japanese Estate Price Bubble (バブル景気, Baburu Keiki or 平成景気,
Heisei Keiki) and the following Employment Ice Age (就職氷河期, Shuushoku
Hyougaki) which caused high unemployment nationwide in Japan. They are also
referred by the term Employment Ice Age Generation (就職氷河期世代, Shuushoku
Hyougaki Sedai) and Lost Generation (失われた世代, Ushinawareta Sedai).

During the Employment Ice Age, the talent, and job search ratio dropped below
0.60, accompanied by a sharp rise of unemployment rate to higher than 5%. It
especially hit hard against young male employees as their unemployment rate
reached 11.6% which is the highest since 1968. This resulted in a drastic
increase of freeter (フリーター, Furita, describe a group of people especially
the youth who don't seek for a stable employment and instead work as a part-time
when in need) and part-timers population. The loosing of the Temporary Staffing
Services Law (労働者派遣法, Roudousha Dekenho) after the review in 1996 and
2004, meaning more corporates are able to hire great proportion of part-timers
in order to reduce their manpower costs, resulted in large amount of workers who
otherwise qualified for a full time employment, get employed as a part-timer
instead. From 1999 to 2019, the percentage of part-timers in the total female
and male workforces had increased from 39.8% to 56.2% and 11.1% to 22.4%
respectively. Note on the differences between the female and male statistics.
Peculiarly, a great amount of workers aged between 15 and 24 years old work as a
part-timer regardless of their gender, which could be seen from the data
provided by the author (45.2% to 57.1% for female, 33.7% to 47.6% for male).

Now coming back to the differences between the female and male statistics. When
we see the overall picture of the workforce in Japan, there were 9.16 million
full-time employees and 3.15 million part-time employees among the Abandoned
Generation in 2008. The population barely changed for the full-time employees in
2018 (9.15 million), but the part-timers had been increased to 3.71 million. The
author found out that male workforces were able to obtain a full-time job as
their full-time employees' population increased and part-time employees'
population decreased in 2018. On the other side of the coin, female workforces
suffered a decrease of about 280 thousand of full-time employees and an increase
of about 930 thousand of part-time employees. It is speculated by the author
that it might due to the discriminatory hire strategy from the market where
women were expected to have maternity leave during their employment. Even after
the reform of Abenomics (安倍ノミクス, Abe No Mikusu), most of them doesn't
experience much wage raise and sometime even with worsen wage. Compare to their
Bubble Generation (バブル世代, Baburu Sedai) counterpart, they have an average
annual income difference of ¥400 to ¥800 thousand. Even when comparing to their
younger counterpart, Yutori Generation (ゆとり世代, Yutori Sedai), their annual
income is still lower. It is also a direct and indirect factor of high amount of
Hikikomori (引きこもり, or known as acute social withdrawal, is a total
withdrawal from society and seeking extreme degrees of social isolation and
confinement) and NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) population,
which increased from 300.5 thousand in 1997 to 390 thousand in 2018.

Not only does the aftermath of the burst of the Japanese Estate Price Bubble
affected the Abandoned Generation in their economic life, it also muddles their
marital status regardless of their gender. In 2005, 31.2% of men and 18.7% of
women aged between 35 and 39 years old, and 22.7% of men and 12.2% of women aged
between 40 and 44 years old were single. In 2015, however, the figure rose to
35% of men and 23.9% of women aged between 35 and 39 years old, and 30% of men
and 19.3% of women aged between 40 and 44 years old were single.

And since there are a great proportion of people from the Abandoned Generation
work as self-employed or part-time. This resulted in a low payment from National
Pension (国民年金, Kokumin Nenkin), mandatory to all residents in Japan aged
between 20 and 60 years old, which is pushing these people into poor economic
condition. Even if they are officially employed by the corporate, since their
salary are often lower (compare to their peers), the payment from the Employee's
Pension Insurance (厚生年金, Kousei Nenkin) will also become lower unless they
were lucky to be employed as a full-time employee when they were fresh
graduates. Such phenomenon could be observed when we look closer to the average
annual income earned by workforce aged from 35 to 44 years old, where those who
employed as a full-time employee immediately as a fresh graduate enjoy ¥5.307
million, and those who later be converted from being a part-timer to full time
employee has only a salary of ¥4.007 million. Notwithstanding the fact that most
of the Abandoned Generation that has a chance to sign in to Employee's Pension
Insurance doesn't sign for it continuously for 40 years. This fact is important
because from the optimistic projection from the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare (厚生労働省, Kousei Roudou Shou) about income replacement ratio was that
it will decrease to 60.2% in 2024 (it was 61.7% in 2020), and plummeted to 50.8%
in 2040 due to sub-replacement fertility. It is with the assumption that the
income replacement ratio is based on 40-year-sign-in of Employee's Pension
Insurance, which mean it could be worse for the Abandoned Generation.

**Note**: There is another way to have pension in Japan: corporate's own
annuities and retirement benefits policies.

The situation appeared to be even worse as we look closer to the National
Pension Insured Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare
once every three years. We see two interesting facts. First, there are 31.8%
people aged between 20 and 34 years old who were overdue their payment for the
National Pension in 2005. The figure decreased to just 18.0% in 2019, and from
here we can see the immediate effect of the economic crisis at the time to the
Abandoned Generation. Second, the total amount of people aged between 35 and 49
years old who applied for full exemption from the pension payment was 970
thousand in 2019, which is a staggering increase from 610 thousand. This
indicates that the situation faced by Abandoned Generation not only doesn't get
improved overtime, but also worse compare to their older generation. The author
argued that it is due to the large amount of people who couldn't afford to pay
their pension payment when they were young since they faced quite a hard time in
employment.

In spite of the predicament the Abandoned Generation faced, the Japanese
government still pushing for increasing Good and Service Tax (GST) from 3% in
1989 to 10% 2019. Lobbyists are pressuring the government to aim for GST
increase to 19% in 2025, which is further supported by IMF for aiming 15% in
2030. However, GST taxes the essential goods that are needed by the low income
population, which is the majority of the Abandoned Generation reside in. Even if
it is for good reason, it is basically a weak support weak scheme that in itself
a negative reinforcement. A just tax structure should have the rich to support the
weak. However, the lobbyists that support for an increase in GST, in turn oppose
such increase in corporate tax, and opted for a decrease instead.

The increasing fee to subscribe National Health Insurance (国民健康保険, Kokumin
Kenko Hoken) due to ever increasing burdern from decreasing subsribers from
agricultural industry and self-employed owners and increasing subscribers from
seniors and part-time employees. The situation became evident as national
average medical fee increased from ¥2,911 in 2000 to ¥5,869 in 2018, which is
twice than in 2000. According to the 2018 survey, 28.6% Japanese from age 0 to
78 subsribed to the Insurance, where a sizable minority from the Abondaned
Generation (18.6% from age 35 to 39, 18.9% from age 40 to 44, and 20.0% from age
45 to 49) form part of the statistics despite the increasing burden. Despite the
fee increase, National Health Insurance still faces financial deficit. The
likely trend, predicted by the author, will be to increase the subscriber fee
which will deepen the predicament faced by the Abandoned Generation in their
difficult financial situation.

There is an estimation done in 2018 that 1.47 million people from Abandoned
Generation that have to apply for Public Assistance (生活保護, Seikatsu Hogo) in
order to satisfy their basic needs. Despite the fact, the Japanese government is
working to lower the support of Public Assistance, reducing food, accommodation,
fuel (winter related) subsidies, with addition of further budget reduction.

According to the projection by National Institute of Population and Social
Security Research (国立社会保証・人口問題研究所, Kokuritsu Shakai Hoshou Jinkou
Mondai KenkyuuJo), the percentage of the population that never married will be
30% for male and 20% for female in 2035, which might be the reality for the
Abandoned Generation in the near future where there will be no child for them to
burden their medical care. In another survey conducted in 2012 by Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Communications (総務省, Soumu Shou), there are 2,399,000
employees that also responsible for taking care of their parents. However, from
2007 to 2012, there are 487,000 employees were forced to resign in order to take
care for their parents, in which 80% of them are female. The mentioned
statistics are important as the Japanese structure of social welfare system
takes the assumption of there will be sufficient family care for the elderly.
Such system, criticised by the author, is obviously not based on the ground. The
birth population of Japan has been decreased from less than 1 million to less
than 900 thousand in 2019. The Abandoned Generation is in the critical situation
where they have to take the burden of family care while at the same time doesn't
have child to support their future senior life.

Not only does the Abandoned Generation suffered under disadvantageous economic
condition, but also mental issues. Based on the statistics gathered by
Federation of Inochi No Denwa (FIND, 日本いのちの電話連盟, Nihon Inochi No Denwa
Renmei), there were 167,820 or 23% of the total number of calls (725,857, where
367,199 are male, 358,658 are female) where individuals age around 30 (87,911 of
them are from male and 79,909 from female) called to the hotline seeking for
consultancy in 2008. 17,731 of them have suicidal tendency, which is 27% of the
total number of suicidal calls (64,488). After ten years (2018), these people,
now age around 40, made 23.7% of the total number of calls (627,475, where
309,565 are male, 317,910 are female) or 148,816 calls. And those who have
suicidal thoughts made 28.3% of the total number of suicidal call (68,398) or
18,373 calls. We can see that among the Abandoned Generation, they face serious
mental issues and stress as the statistics barely improved on them.

Among the people that lived in poverty, 19.4% of them are seniors, which is
higher than average compare to international community. The author predicts that
this percentage will reach 30% as the Abandoned Generation reaching the age.
Moreover, around 1.58 million people who were unmarried, 45- to 54-year-old,
and live with their parents in 2016 that were either unemployed, NEET, or
contract workers, 310 thousands of them were relying on their parents to
maintain basic needs. From age 35- to 44-year-old, there are 288 thousands
people face the same issue. Worryingly, those same families have little
financial resources to take care of their children and facing great risk of
bankruptcy.

The trend of the gig economy around the globe may even worsen the economic and
mental situation of the Abandoned Generation as it doesn't guarantee employee
benefits and is forced to pack into a tight time constraint to deliver services.
There might be a chance for them to fight against the capital via collective
bargaining through unionisation, but the author is pessimistic about the
strength of the Japanese union.
