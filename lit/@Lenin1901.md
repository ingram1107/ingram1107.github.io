Lenin warned about the increase opportunistic tendency in German
Social-Democratic Party (SDP) due to the rising of Bernsteinism and stated that
he rejects any kind of class conciliation. He criticised the Russian
Social-Democrat newspaper Robocheye Dyelo of defending Bernsteinism by allowing
"freedom of criticism", thus making those opportunistic opinions shielded from
criticism and hindering individual opinions. He worried about the domination of
such opportunism will lead to the elimination of revolutionary socialist
thoughts on legal publication in Russia.

Hereby, he introduced Economism, a political philosophy believes that trade
unionist should carry only economic struggles whereas the Marxist should merge
with liberals for political struggles. Lenin believes in no eclecticism
(arbitrary selections) in principle formulation, meaning there should be no
bargaining and concession over the theory as the theory is important to advance
the social movement and avoid confusion among the proletarian. Engels stated, he
quoted, there are three sides of struggles: theory, politic, and practical
economy (resisting capitalists); and each struggle should be advance
systematically and in harmony.
