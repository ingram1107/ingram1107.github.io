Luxemburg noticed that the differences between the underlying conditions for the
German and Russian proletariat: while German workers suffered from Bismark's
antisocialist policies for many years, nevertheless lie on the ground where
bourgeois society was flourishing and was highly developed. In contrast, the
autocracy efforts to prolong its regime rule in Russia resulted in a weak
bourgeois political force. This gave the ongoing effort from the [Social
Democracy](../202204211120.md)#, pushed by Menshevik, Bolshevik #lenin and
Social Revolutionaries, a democrartic-revolutionary character, but at the same
time set in the challenge for the Socialist to spread to the class awareness by
themselves as there were no intense class antagonism resulted from capitalism.

As the nature of feudal autocracy is of autonomy and decentralisation, any
revolution that comes after it will be of centralism, Luxemburg argued. It can
been seen from the Social Democracy movement in Russia as well.
