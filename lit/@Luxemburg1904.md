Luxemburg noticed that the differences between the underlying conditions for the
German and Russian proletariat: while German workers suffered from Bismark's
antisocialist policies for many years, nevertheless lie on the ground where
bourgeois society was flourishing and was highly developed. In contrast, the
autocracy efforts to prolong its regime rule in Russia resulted in a weak
bourgeois political force. This gave the ongoing effort from the [Social Democracy](../202204211120.md)#,
pushed by Menshevik, Bolshevik #lenin and Social Revolutionaries, a
democratic-revolutionary character, but at the same time set in the challenge
for the Socialist to spread to the class awareness by themselves as there were
no intense class antagonism resulted from capitalism.

There is no objection from Luxemburg that Social Democracy is inherent
centralism, as local and group interests are set aside, in favour of the class
interests of the proletariat. Because of this, the socialist revolution is
inherently different from those from Jacobin and Blanquism as it comes from the
mass instead of coming from the top.

She critiqued the Lenin's work, One Step Forward, Two Steps Backward, as plain
Blanquism as it requested the total submission of the working mass to the party
Central Committee instead lending autonomy to the masses to mobilise the
resources available, and the separation of revolutionary elites from the mass.
It has the danger of trying to control the wide revolution into a narrow
movement. She argued that revolutionary parties played little role in the
development of the revolution, as made evidence of the spontaneous action of
Russian general strike of 1908 in St. Petersburg. Instead, the main role of the
party is to consolidate the gains from the mass, to preserve the fruit of the
struggles.

Luxemburg further elaborated the concept of discipline is not about obedience to
the top, it's the discipline of proletariat to consciously act according to
their class interests. This requires the extirpating the old obedience and
servility. Therefore, the subordination to the Central Committee is inherently
contradictory.
