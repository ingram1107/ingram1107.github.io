Ten Days That Shook the World records John Reed's eyewitnesses and his
experience of the October Revolution. As a socialist journalist, his method of
documenting such dramatic event in the human history is revolutionary and
insightful on the subject.

## February Revolution and Its Material Condition

Reed pointed out that before the total defeat of the Imperial Russian Army in
1917, it has been disorganised since 1915, due to Tsar's Court appeasement
tendency, lack of arms which resulted in the Great Retreat in 1915, lack of food
in major cities (felling ration of bread and sugar), and manufacture plant's and
transportation's breakdown in 1916. These factors contribute to the happening of
bourgeois February Revolution, in which the Provisional Government replaced the
Imperial Crown as a political entity. Reed distinguishes political and social
revolution, where the former focuses on the replacement of political
institution, and the latter focuses on the improvement on social condition of
the people. The clear implication here is that February Revolution is a limited
political revolution.

He argues against the doubt on the lack of consciousness of the Russian
proletariats due to the huge membership, of 12 million, of the Russia consumer
cooperative societies, which are dominated by moderate socialists, Mensheviks
and Social Revolutionaries (SR), and the rise of the factory-shop committees
which are control by autonomous workers. Another evidence to this is the rising
need of political literature for the public especially for the working people.
The term *oborontsi* is referred to the socialists that support WWI
continuation, especially those from Mensheviks and Right SR.

Reed records that although wages had been improved 500%, it was simply due to
the ruble depreciation. The prices of food and necessities had skyrocketed to
556% and 1,109% respectively. Other political reforms had also faced significant
setbacks including non-complete Army Committee reform (harsh treatment from
officer), jailed Land Committees for implementing government regulation,
black-listing and lockouts on wage labourer. Political exiles are often not
accepted to return to their homeland. Worsen economic conditions increases the
economic crime rate especially those of robberies and housebreaking, resulting
in all-night armed guard in resident apartments.

There was a fear on another postponement on the November Constitute Assembly
Election and opted for proceeding to Soviet Election, aka All-Russian Congress.
Due to major electoral defeats of Mensheviks and SR in the urban areas, earlier
Soviet election, before November Constitute Assembly, faced opposition from
major committees, and instead advocated for its postponement. Provisional
Government was also actively suppressing radical propaganda efforts from
revolutionary elements. In Peasant's Soviets, however, they were more
conservative to the revolutionary ideas due to their slow development of
consciousness and generation of agitation from SR. Reed had observed the rising
schism within SR with more prominent left SR tendencies.

Reed had noticed the rising reactions to the current political institution and
revolutionary fervour, accompany by increasing support from the bourgeois for
foreign intervention to crush a potential socialist-dominated assembly. With the
rise of Bolsheviks that swung Russian politics to further left, bourgeois and
reactionaries were coming together to initiate several noncooperation movements
to discredit February Revolution.

## The Establishment of Provisional Government

In September, Kornilov attempted to coup the Kerensky Government, but failed to
do so as he was arrested by the Soldiers' Committees before any damage has been
done. Reed claimed that Kerensky had some responsibility for the coup, as he
implied that Kerensky had the foresight and information about Kornilov
intention. Note that Bolsheviks position was still pretty weak before the
shenanigans. After the coup attempt, the February Government entered the crisis
mode, as Savinkov, the incumbent Deputy War Minister, refused summoned by the
Central Committee of SR, and as a result, he was expelled from the membership of
SR.

With the collapse of February Government, Kerensky tried to form a coalition
government with the Cadets (Constitutional Democratic Party). However, he faced
with significant backlash from his party (SR) and popular demand, and eventually
back down and establish instead a temporary Directorate of Five Old Ministers.

All-Russian Democratic Conference was called, with three faction formed:
Bolsheviks, Centre-Left (centre and left SR with centre Mensheviks and
Mensheviks Internationalists), and the Right. Bolsheviks demanded that
All-Russian Congress of Soviets to be summoned. The Centre-Left opted instead
for a pure Socialist Government without Cadets' components. The Right supports
Kerensky's solution.

The initial representative list for the Conference was revised to include more
cooperative societies (reminded that they are dominated by moderate socialists)
and conservative bodies (like Zemstovs' and municipalities' representatives).
Despite that, the first vote was passed in the Conference to form a Socialist
Government. However, due to the fear of rising Bolsheviks political powers as
they had won majorities in several major cities (Petrograd, Moscow, Kiev, Odessa
etc.) and the threat of Kerensky to resign, the Conference was instead voted for
a coalition government. The new government then establish the Provisional
Council that is consultative but hold no legislative power, with bourgeois great
influence over the Ministry and the Council as Reed claimed. Not long after, the
broadcast body of All-Russian Central Executive Committee (Tsay-ee-kah),
Izvestia hinted at the dissolution of the Soviets, accompany by the announcement
from the government to liquidate "irresponsible organisation" aiming at the
Soviets. Bolsheviks withdraw from Provisional Council, and on 2 November,
summoned All-Russian Soviets to meet at Petrograd. In the meantime, Cadets in
the Council was attempted to destroy Soldiers and Sailors' Committees, denounced
the Soviets, and delegitimised Russian Republic. Mensheviks Internationalists
and Left SR remained in the Council to advocate Bolshevik slogans for immediate
peace, land distribution, and worker ownership on the factories.
