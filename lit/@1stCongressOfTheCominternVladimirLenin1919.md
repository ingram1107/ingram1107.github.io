Lenin defined dictatorship (March 4 speech, line 3) as:

> the conquest of political power and forceable suppression of the resistance
> always offered by the exploiters

Lenin argued that (March 4 speech, line 13):

> Democracy assumed different forms and was applied in different degrees in the
> ancient republics of Greece, the medieval cities and the advanced capitalist
> countries.

Therefore, justify the destruction of the [capitalist state
apparatus](../202204202040.md)# in order to wield a new form of democracy that
suited to the proletariat class.

Lenin advocated the merge of the legislative and executive power of the state,
adhere to his principle in [@VladimirLenin1918](@VladimirLenin1918.md).
