There is a plan to install a capacity of 2,800 MW of concentrating solar thermal
power (CSP) and 700 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) by 2027.

The most mature technology for PV is that of single and polycrystalline Silicone
cells.

CSP is suitable in hot dry region as they utilise the direct normal irradiation
where they will directly used it for heating the steam. PV, instead, is more
suitable if the region receive only low solar irradiation as they are benefitted
from scattered and diffuse irradiance. PV will first convert them into direct
current (DC), which later will be converted into alternating current (AC) to
enter the electricity grip.

Egypt receives 2,000 to 3,000 kWh per square meter annually from North to South.

The total generation cost for CSP and PV is $2,733,225,069.02 (2010 US dollar
value, $3,663,787,076.60 after inflation adjustment in 2022, which is RM
16,102,344,201.66) and $1,383,981,004.58 (2010 US dollar value,
$1,855,175,329.80 after inflation adjustment in 2022, which is RM
8,153,495,574.47) for the first (CSP:PV is 4:1) and the second scenario (only PV
is installed) by 2027.

**Note**: Concentrating Solar Power = CSP

**Note**: Photovoltaic = PV

**Note**: Levelised Cost of Electricity = LCOE

# Aftermath

What's the composition of CSP and PV in Egypt in 2022? In renewable energy
sector, PV occupies 22 percent and CSP occupies only 3. This is an almost 1:7
(CSP:PV) ratio. [^ita2020]

It seems like the Egyptian government accepted the advice from this paper to
priorities the installment of PV.
