The authors proposed a compact forwarding table that is small enough to fit into
a cache from a general purpose CPU of a [Router](../202207061800.md), which
allows fast [IP routing](../202207061815.md) lookup in software without the fear
of expensive hardware upgrade. Forwarding table is the local version of routing
table from CPU in the router's input ports. Although there are [Data Link Layer](../202206131651.md)
technologies such as flow or tag architecture like [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](../202209221012.md),
it adds complexity and redundancy to the network which could be unnecessary.
Traditional forwarding tables that based on Patricia tree are large due to the
increasing requirement on the size of the address cache, and there are too many
expensive memories referenced needed to search up.

The forwarding table data structure proposed is a tree with 3 leaves divided
into 3 levels based on power of 2 (0, 16, and 24), which would mean 4 memory
accesses for each level. In worst case scenario, there could be 12 memory
accesses needed for a single forwarding lookup, but this is fairly unlikely. It
minimises the number of memory access, which is the main bottleneck of the
forwarding lookup, and its size so that it could fit in a cache or at least most
frequently visited route are stored inside it. The locality of the traffic
pattern will keep the most frequent used piece of the data structure in the
cache, therefore the most lookups will be fast. The secondary goal is to keep
entities naturally aligned in order to avoid expensive instructions and
bit-extraction operations.

The authors pointed out that the nature of routing entries that can have the
same next-hop route, in which we can utilise it and share them among the
entries, further reducing the table's size.

The authors also mentioned that finding the proper routing information is pretty
similar to the more general interval set membership problem.
