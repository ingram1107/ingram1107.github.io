True democracy can't be achieved if the means of production and political power
doesn't lie in the hand of the exploited. The demands for real freedom and
equality from the proletariat is impossible under the bourgeois democracy.

Lenin criticised the main figures of the SPD (Sozialdemokratische Partei
Deutschlands), Scheidemanns and Kaustky for being defending the bourgeois
democracy and refusing to destroy the [On State](../202204202040.md)# apparatus.

Lenin repeated the sentiment in his book
[@VladimirLenin1918](@VladimirLenin1918.md) that the state is simply a machine
for the oppressor to suppress the oppressed class, even if such machine is the
most democratic republic, which is considered an advancement from monarchy.

Bourgeois democracy is, in fact, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. It is a
democracy for the rich, a democracy for the capitalists, not for the poor, not
for the proletariat and peasants. This is because the capitalist class control
most of the state apparatus, that is, the ability to designate bourgeois judge,
bourgeois officials etc., and debarred the participation of the poor into the
democratic politics by the protection of private property, as they control most
of the best quality buildings and stocks of presses.

Lenin advocated the dethroning of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and
replace it by the dictatorship of the proletariat. This means replacing the
democracy for the rich by the democracy for the poor. This means replacing the
freedom of assembly and the press for the minority (the exploiters) by the
freedom of assembly and the press for the majority (the exploited). This means
replacing the bourgeois state with the proletarian state.
