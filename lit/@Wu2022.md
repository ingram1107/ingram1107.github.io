This paper proposes an approach for railway line planning and design method
based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology. Railway station's
visual operation and maintenance management system is constructed by BIM.

To minimise traffic load and delay in the network, edge computing technique is
deployed by the authors.

BIM technology is a data-based tool applied to engineering design, construction,
and management.

To plan and design railway line, the authors collect information such as
geometric information, professional attribute, and status information of all
components in the railway station via IoT devices (sensors, networked based
stations, surveillance cameras). These data are then transmitted to the IoT
information platform for system scheduling, which are later analysed and
processed by AI to realise real-time and dynamic management of resources and
information in the operation of the station.
