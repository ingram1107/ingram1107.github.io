This paper focuses on the implementation strategy for IoT for rail assets to
increase maintenance efficiency, minimise rail service interruption, and improve
customer experience while putting workers at lesser risks under health and
safety hazard.

There were 3.23% planned journey cancelled in UK in 2016, resulted in Â£28
million refund claimed by customers.

The IoT system comprises four level of data and control flow between the
physical devices and IoT application: the physical devices themselves (data
acquisition and asset control), IoT gateway device (data aggregation or
segregation), edge or fog information technology (IT) and operational technology
(OT) (data processing, analytics, and control), and cloud (data and control
management).

The software infrastructure that connects the IoT devices contains three
components: the cyber-model that virtually represent the physical devices, big
data analytics, and the IoT application.

The implementation strategy for IoT should enable predictive maintenance,
provide common data environment, allow remote access and maintenance, monitor
assets condition in real-time, and enabling automation of maintenance
activities. Predictive maintenance is achieved through IoT sensors and the
creation of rail assets historical failure models. Though new measurement train
(NMT) exists, IoT extends PLPR technology to track geotechnical assets by
scanning image and soil parameters. Common data environment enhances data
standardisation and optimal usage across board in industry. To ensure data
quality, integrity, and cross-disciplinary harmonised data usage, informational
data such as train design information, train embedded sensors data,
interferometric synthetic aperture radar data, and maintenance staff
communication and information system (allow real-time reference) should be
integrated into CDE. Combining with AIM with IoT's remote access capability, it
enables simultaneous replica of physical assets through seamless data
collection. Devices such as sensors, drones, robots, LiDAR scanners, AR, and VR
hardware can act as agent for interfacing physical environment and digital twin
(IoT plus AIM) to enhance bidirectional data flow for remote inspection.
Real-time monitoring can be achieved via alarm and just-in-time notification.
BIM technology with VR can be used for real-time monitoring, but both
technologies do not synchronous together. QR and RFID can be used for automatic
identification, and with combination of edge or fog computing and machine
learning, the IoT system can trigger initialise emergency protocol for automatic
maintenance.

AI, AR, edge or fog or cloud computing, robotics, and Asset Information
Modelling (AIM) are the enabling technologies that make IoT implementation
strategy possible.
