Marshall observed that geographical factors such as physical boundaries
(mountains, rivers, forests etc.), climate, demographics, cultural regions,
natural resources etc. are often overlooked in geopolitical analysis. Even after
much advancement in technologies, these factors are not eliminated from
influencing national interests and decisions.

Looking at the example of Russia, it faces west towards the European plain which
stretch to France, which lies its upmost interests in securing its position.
Since Poland has a relatively narrow corridor, controlling Poland could allow
Russia drives forces to prevent advancement into its heartland. However, this
could bite back strategically as the border is stretch far beyond any nation
ability to defend all of them (about 2,000 miles or 3,218 km). Even with this
drawback, the strategic depth of the Russia from this point is too large for a
nation to invade, as seen in the example of Napoleon campaign to Russia in 1812
and Operation Barbarossa in 1941, where the logistics problems became too much
to handle.
