Marshall observed that geographical factors such as physical boundaries
(mountains, rivers, forests etc.), climate, demographics, cultural regions,
natural resources etc. are often overlooked in geopolitical analysis. Even after
much advancement in technologies, these factors are not eliminated from
influencing national interests and decisions.

## Russia

Looking at the example of Russia, it faces west towards the European plain
stretches to France, which lies its upmost interests in securing its position.
Since Poland has a relatively narrow corridor, controlling Poland could allow
Russia drives forces to prevent advancement into its heartland. However, this
could bite back strategically as the border is stretch far beyond any nation
ability to defend all of them (about 2,000 miles or 3,218 km). Even with this
drawback, the strategic depth of the Russia from this point is too large for a
nation to invade, as seen in the example of Napoleon campaign to Russia in 1812
and Operation Barbarossa in 1941, where the logistics problems became too much
to handle. Nevertheless, it is true that most invasion to Russia were mostly
coming from the North European Plain by Poles in 1605, Swedes in 1708, France in
1812, Crimean War in 1853, and German in 1914 and 1941. Because of the flatland
nature of the European Plain that is not protected from mountains, desserts, and
with few rivers obstacles, Russia resorted to aggressive defence stance:
consolidating the home region, and moving outwards. Such geopolitical thinking
is at nerve especially after the collapse of Warsaw Pact and the creeping in to
former soviet republics from North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and
European Union (EU). Looking to the far east, it is protected by uncultivated
tundra, and even if the opponents could get as far as Ural Mountains, massive
logistic problem due to large territory (75% area of Russia) and long supply
line can be hardly ignored by any invading nation. Despite this fact, Russia
itself has a small and declining population (144 million, only 22% in Siberia)
due to low birth and life expectancy, short agricultural season that pressures
equitable distribution, and little railway networks except Trans-Siberian
Railway and Baikal-Amur Mainline. It is hard to project power to Mongolia and
China because of its long supply line and lack of manpowers. The author
predicted that parts of Siberia might eventually come under China cultural and
political control by taking advantage of Russian depopulation and Chinese
emigration.

There is a perpetual warm-port seeking plagues the Russia national decision.
Ports such as Murmansk in Arctic freezes several months, and Vladivostok in Sea
of Japan freezes around 4 months, not mentioning that Japan dominated in that
maritime area. Due to this fact, it prevents Russian fleet from projecting its
power globally and makes it nervous of the lost of potential fleet holding. For
centuries, it sought to control Constantinople (now Istanbul) and even gain
access to the Persian Gulf. This explains why Russia decided to act boldly to
annex Crimea from Ukraine when it felt that Ukraine was getting closer to EU or
NATO in 2013-4 to secure Sevastopol, even it is restricted by Bosporus Strait
(controlled by NATO member Turkey and abided to Montreux Convention 1936). It is
unimaginable for Russia to lose Crimea, but an acceptable loss to the West. Even
if it can bypass the Bosporus and now having a limited supply naval base in
Tartus, Syria, Gibraltar (controlled by NATO member UK) and Suez Canal
(controlled by Egypt, a US ally) are still major obstacles to Russian fleet. To
increase its Black Sea naval capacity, Russia builds up Novorossiysk despite its
nature of not being a deep port. If feasible, controlling Moldavia can guard
against the Black Sea plain corridors and strengthen Russian grip on the
maritime region, but forcing into Moldavia can be costly due to the crossing of
Dnieper and the use of Odessa as staging post which might trigger severe NATO
reactions. The possible counteract from the US can be boosting Romanian naval
power and relying on Turkey power on the Black Sea. On the other hand, Baltic
Sea fleet faces an enormous predicament to break through the Skagerrak Strait
(controlled by NATO members Denmark and Norway) and later the GIUK gap
(Greenland, Ireland, and UK).

**Note**: New development on the expansion of NATO included Finland as part of
its member in 4th April 2023, which put Gulf of Finland mostly under West
control. This puts Baltic Sea fleet in a detrimental disadvantage.

The trump card of Russia, other than the nuclear missiles, is its vast energy
reserves, particularly gas and oil. In fact, major players in EU like Germany
and Poland have heavy reliant on Russian energy to power up their winter needs.
Now, there are four pipelines to supply European countries' energy: North
Stream, Yamal Pipelines, Blue Stream, and Turk Stream. It is interesting that
there was once a plan to build a gas pipeline supplying Bulgaria, Serbia,
Greece, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria, and Italy, named South Stream. Before its
cancellation in 2015, most of these countries refused to condemn Russian
annexation of Crimea. The further east we look at the European continent, the
more reliant of them on the Russian natural gas and oil, especially those of
Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) and Finland. It doesn't help that
most of the Baltic States have a substantial amount of Russian minorities that
are currently being underrepresented and discriminated by, and the fact that
Baltic States present as a weak link of Russian defensive line. We can't rule
out the possibility that Russia might one day uses the same excuse on those
states to rescue ethnic Russian, written in Russian law, as on Ukraine. Moldavia
is in no better economic situation as like its European fellows rely on the
feeding from Russian energy and additionally export of its crops and wine to
Russia. More threatening to the Moldavia security concerns is the existing
separatist movements of de-facto independent Transnistria which is pro-Russia as
its demographics are mostly consists of Russia ethic group. It can be a
deterrent to Moldavia from joining EU and/or NATO. The US trying to pull EU away
from its reliant on Russian energy by the means of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
exportation and its terminal infrastructures. Additionally, there are also
existing LNG terminals from North Africa and Middle East to compete with Russian
gas and oil. If things get worse, Russia always has the alternative to seek
sales in China.

You might notice that there is no mention of Georgia geopolitical importance to
Russia since it was invaded by the latter in 2008. Fortunate to Russia, because
of the aftermath of Russo-Georgian War, it successfully knocked out Georgia from
being a threat, with the addition of its alliance to Armenia and the fact that
Georgia lie south of the natural boundaries of Caucasian Mountains. Unless
Georgia is getting too close to the Western power, Russia should lie its focus
westward. Russia will try its power to meddle in South America, Middle East
(albeit with declining influences since the end of the USSR), Arctic, and
Greenland to compete with US in geopolitical theatre. Such attempt could be seen
in the Mediterranean exercise in May 2015 with China where both parties with
mutual interests: China tried to extend its naval power reach, and Russia
deterred Greece from threatening its base on Tartus, Syria.

**Note**: The relationship between Armenia and Russia might be becoming
increasingly stiffen due to its inaction during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War
in 2020. It might again force Russia to reconsider its strategy in Caucasian
region.

**Note**: Marshall concluded that the fall USSR was due to the combination
effects of its overstretch, poor financial management, not people-oriented
economic system, and the defeat in Afghanistan.

## China

Coming to the geography of China, it adapts the attack as defence strategy same
as Russia to reach natural barriers like Tibet Plateau, Gobi Desert, and
Xinjiang in order to protect its heartland, North China Plain, lies between the
Yellow River and Yangtze River with rich agriculture. Especially the Tibet
Plateau, it plays an important role in fixing China geopolitical problem, such
that its annexation avoid major powers like India to move in and threaten
Chinese heartland. Tibet Plateau gives a height advantage and the control of
sources of Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River to any player to
project their power. Gobi Desert, though historically a troublesome terrain for
Chinese dynasties to deal with nomad threats, has become a buffer as any huge
mobilisation can be detected in early stage due to the advancement of modern
reconnaissance. Add into difficulty to the aggressors, there are few roads for
heavy armour manoeuvre and few habitable areas which imposes a long supply lines
for them to enter Inner Mongolia. To further secure its geopolitical position,
China tries to pull Mongolia into its sphere of influence via trading with the
benefits of getting its minerals. This left two geopolitical weakness on the
North of China: Russia's Far East and Kazakhstan. Though Russia and China have
become good partners to resist United States' military powers, it is in nature
an alliance of convenience. In fact, due to the sanctions, Russia becomes the
junior partner of China, and its Far East increasingly falls into the influence
of China as the continuous migration Manchuria residents into the Far East. Now
coming to the border with Kazakhstan, it is simply not a threat as Kazakh and
Russian don't impose a significant threat to China since attacking it requires
long supply line from Russia even though there are weak spots in between deserts
and mountains. Xinjiang now acts as a buffer to the heartland, albeit its
turbulence nature due to its Muslim Uighur population resistance to the
integration. But China is nervous about the possible independence of Xinjiang
since it has plenty of fossil fuel resources and nuclear testing sites, and it
is a key of "One Belt, One Road" initiative connecting to its deep-water naval
base in Gwadar, Pakistan. Looking to the south, the border is secure by Burma's
mountainous terrain and Laos's hilly juggle that are difficult to launch a
massive military campaign from there. The border with Vietnam remains a
manageable problem for China as it doesn't provide many geography features to
protect Vietnam from army aggression as Chinese military powers grow.

**Note**: Vietnam has to either cling to US to seek protection from China or get
close to China to avoid possible clashes.

As the Western powers, primarily the British Empire and Russia Tsardom, came
into contact with China, coastal cities become increasingly important due to
switching focus on agriculture to trading. After decades of development, there
is a wide wealth and life quality gap between the coastland and inland cities.
More depressing fortune for the latter cities that lies on rich soils, 40% of
arable land are polluted or has thinning topsoil suitable for farming due to
industrialisation efforts, which could threaten the food production in China.
This is an undesirable but at the same time necessary measurement taken by the
Chinese government due to one sole factor: Its burden to govern over 1.4 billion
people. If the unity of the whole country doesn't be enforced, China may crumble
like its historical predecessors. Thus, the integration of territories consists
of minorities and the promise of economic progress must be prioritised over
autonomous local decision-making and democracy. The former could be seen from
the Community Party of China (CPC) incorporation of Tibet assets by bring in
modern infrastructures, such as railway system and highway, into the plateau,
which also attracts immigration from Han people into the region. It's the same
case as in Manchuria (where the Machu people have been successfully integrated
into China) and Xinjiang. But just like in Xinjiang, this could escalate the
ethnic tensions there amid increasing appearance of Han people and their
cultural domination in the region and eventually explodes into ethic conflicts
like Uighur unrest in 2018. Coming back to the economic progression, if CPC
can't keep up with their promise to grow their economy, resulting in a stagnant
economy, the conflicts between the countryside and urban will resurface, and the
resentment over the government may rise across the country.

Nevertheless, the security over the land makes China confident in focusing its
efforts to develop its blue-water navy in order to project power other than its
coastline, that is guarded by green-water navy. The author predicts that China
could rival US naval power in 2045. Its ambition can be seen on its claims over
the Ten Dash Line (includes Taiwan) with the purpose to control the most
important passageway in South China Sea albeit at the cost of reefing the
relationship with its maritime South East Asia (SEA) neighbours. It aims to
become a two-ocean naval power that secure its trade route in Pacific and Indian
Ocean. First, let's discuss the main problem of accessing to Pacific Ocean from
the Chinese perspective: the first island chain. Most of the choke points are
controlled by US ally, Japan, including the Sea of Japan, La Pérouse Strait
between Russian Sakhalin Island and Japan Hokkaido, and Ryukyu Islands. Even if
Chinese blue-water navy could somehow pass through the north-western choke
points dominated by Japanese navy, Kuril Islands still impose a difficult
passage to the Pacific Ocean as the contentious territorial disputes between
Japan and Russia is undergoing and exacerbated due to the waning power
projection of Russia to the Sea of Okhotsk. To the west, China disputes the
ownership of the Senkaku Island or Diaoyu Island in an attempt to break through
the chain, but US and Japan military presences in Okinawa in Ryukyu Islands
remain a deterrent for the Chinese navy. The weak link of the first island chain
is Taiwan, in which the Chinese government sort to gain control over it via soft
power via trades and tourism. In addition, China has an operational advantage in
supply and response time as its mainland possession has only 140 miles or 225 km
away from Taiwan versus US's 6,400 miles or 10,300 km. Therefore, gaining
control over the East China Sea air superiority is a primary objective for
Chinese successful strategic deployment and may be a heat point in the future.
Looking at the Indian Ocean, we immediately see that Malacca Strait imposes a
choke point for China to reach the energy-rich Persian Gulf. Adding worse to the
matter, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries are not
necessarily in a good term with China due to their claims over the South China
Sea. China approaches this disadvantage with a combination of carrots and sticks
tactic to sway those countries to give in their grasp on the Sea and the Malacca
Strait. By carrots, we mean trade deals and tourism. By sticks, it means
increasing militarisation of South China Sea by turning the rocks into islands
with military facilities such as port and runway, and threats. There are
attempts from China to bypass the Strait entirely by establishing deep-water
ports in Burma, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, in which the most important
ports are in Pakistan and Burma. To further cut its reliance on Malacca Strait,
it built gas and oil pipelines in Burma west coastline to link Bay of Bengal to
South-Western China, in which 80% of energy went through these pipelines to
supply its residents' and military's needs. China even go so far to venture to
Africa to seek for minerals and precious metals. However, US and Japan are not
sitting ducks and planning to check China in Burma.
