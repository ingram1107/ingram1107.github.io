Egypt produced 92 TW of energy in 2003, and the paper Patlitzianas, 2011
forecasted the demand will rise to 188 TW for the country.

Solar energy involves several active solar technologies such as *photovoltaic
systems*, *concentrated solar power* and *solar water heating*.

Aswan in Beban, Egypt is the largest solar plants in the world. It produces
1,465 MW of energy, equivalent to 90% of the electricity came from the High Dam.
It occupies 8,843 acres and has an area of 37 square km.

The lack of governmental support and regulations, lack of customer's awareness
of environmentally friendly products and lack of environmental specialists
affect the willingness of the companies to implement GSCM in Beban, Egypt.
