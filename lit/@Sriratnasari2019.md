This paper proposes suggestions on improving management of DKI Jakarta
transportation system with the integration of IoT, in order to solve the
congestion problem in Jabodetabek line (Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi)
which results in yearly loss of 100 trillion Rupee.

There are three railway system in Jakarta: KRL, PT MRT, and LRT. (pg. 4, Section II)

MRT partners with GrabPay to implement electronic ticket payment and
TransJakarta (bus transit) as first mile and last mile connectivity. (pg. 4,
Section II)

Cameras, RFID, and sensors data should be utilised on helping decision-making.
(pg. 4, Section III)

TransJakarta has already deployed On Board Unit (OBU), an electronic device, to
monitor bus position, bus ID, speed, direction etc. It also collaborates with
Trafi to aid in giving travel planning advices. (pg. 4, Section III)

The authors define the IoT architecture into four layers: (1) **perception
layer** (collect data), (2) **computing layer** (load balancing), (3) **network
layer** (connectivity), and (4) **application layer** (storage or processing).
(pg. 5, Section III A)

Peculiar attention should be given to XG cellular technology as it requires
stead power supply. Extensive bandwidth may be required due to enormous data
collection. Another thing to be paid attention to are hardware and connectivity
security. (pg. 5, Section III A)

Integration between different mass transportation services with transportation
network system in the form of uniform user application interface may increase
the use of public transport. (pg. 5, Section III A)
