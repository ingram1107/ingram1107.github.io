# Predictive Life Cycle Model

Use predictive [System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)](202303251030.md) when the
project scope is clearly defined, and the schedule and cost can be predicted
(due to the familiarities to the technologies used). Examples of predictive life
cycle model are:
- Waterfall Model (linear stage)
- Spiral Model (iterative or spiral approach)
- Incremental Release Model
- [Prototyping](202207120959.md)
- Rapid Application Development (RAD, concurrent development, usually use for
  #oop [Projects](202303251004.md))
