# Terraform Data Source

#[HashiCorp Terraform](202205041220.md) could provision other resources that are
managed by other [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](202206061419.md) tools or manual
maintenance using Data Sources. However, it doesn't have any permission other
than reading the infrastructure in contrast to [Terraform Providers](202206072140.md).
It can be defined in [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)](202206061645.md)#
as follows:

```hcl
data {data-source} {data-source-name} {
  ...
}
```

As you can see, it has highly similar syntax with [resource block](202206072140.md).
We can use the variable inside the Data Source by
`data.{data-source}.{data-source-name}.{variable}`.
