# Docker Service

#[202110201636](202110201636.md) Service could be helpful on managing an application across
multiple Docker hosts. It plays an important role in Docker's [202203291434](202203291434.md)#.

We can create multiple instances of an application within a cluster by calling
the command `docker service create --replicas={number} {image-name}` with the
corresponding [202202211632](202202211632.md).
