# Docker Service

#[Docker](202110201636.md) Service could be helpful on managing an
application across multiple Docker hosts. It plays an important role in Docker's
[Container Orchestration](202203291434.md)#.

We can create multiple instances of an application within a
[cluster](202304251207.md) by calling the command `docker service create
--replicas={number} {image-name}` with the corresponding
[Docker Image](202202211632.md).
