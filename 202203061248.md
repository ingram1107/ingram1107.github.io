# Debugging Tools

There are various debugging tools that a programmer could use to find out what
is going wrong in the codebase. Some provides great visualisation of the data
suggested by [Hunt et al](lit/@Hunt1999.md).

## Compilers

When debugging, the warning flags or messages provided by compilers, transpiler
or REPL should be the first choice on noticing potential bugs that could exist
in the codebase. It is going to help in eliminating most of the deterministic
bugs.

- C compiler with verbose warning flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Wformat-nonliteral
  -Wcast-align -Wpointer-arith -Wbad-function-cast -Wmissing-prototypes
  -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -Winline -Wundef -Wnested-externs
  -Wcast-qual -Wshadow -Wwrite-strings -Wno-unused-parameter -Wfloat-equal
  -pedantic -ansi`)[^1]
- C++ compiler with verbose warning flags (`-pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wcast-align
  -Wcast-qual -Wctor-dtor-privacy -Wdisabled-optimization -Wformat=2 -Winit-self
  -Wlogical-op -Wmissing-declarations -Wmissing-include-dirs -Wnoexcept
  -Wold-style-cast -Woverloaded-virtual -Wredundant-decls -Wshadow
  -Wsign-conversion -Wsign-promo -Wstrict-null-sentinel -Wstrict-overflow=5
  -Wswitch-default -Wundef -Werror -Wno-unused`)[^1]
- Rustc/Cargo for Rust programming language

## Static Code Analysis Tools

Static code analysis tools could be used to check security vulnerabilities and
ensure code quality of the software before it compiled into binary. It will find
all possible (if the flag is set so) questionable styles, that could to lead to
disastrous consequences, and lint it to the developers.

- Coverity
- Cppcheck
- [Memory Debugger](202302121756.md)

## Iterative Debuggers

Iterative debuggers are useful tool in debugging a program by analysing their
information in binary or sometimes ELF files in [Linux](202204081225.md)
environment. These debuggers could let you set breakpoints in between the
sequence of the control flow. Some have even great ability to visualise the data
that you're set to inspect. Instead of attaching ELF to the binary file, we can
split debug information by appending the compilation flag with `-gsplit-dwarf`
to split the debug information of types, classes, and identifiers from the
executable binary.

- [GDB](202203071127.md)# especially with `-g3` option for more verbose
  debugging information. However, it will increase the link time as the linker
  needs to parse all the debug information of all translation units.
- LLDB
- MSVC
- UDB
- Data Display Debugger (DDD), a graphical front-end for multiple debuggers such
  as [GDB](202203071127.md)#, DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl
  debugger, bashdb, remake, and pydb.

## Time-Travel Debuggers

To-do: what is time-travel debuggers and why does it help?

- [GDB](202203071127.md)# (??)
- rr
- LiveRecorder
- UDB

## Sanitisers

Sanitisers are tools that could help in inspecting various aspect of the
program, such as memory address, thread information, undefined behaviour etc. by
reading the debugging symbols, which could be produced by compilers using the
option `-fsanitize={address|thread|undefined|leak}`.

- AddressSanitizer (ASan)
- ThreadSanitizer (TSan)
- UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer (UBSan)
- LeakSanitizer (LSan)

## Dynamic Program Analysers

Dynamic Program Analyzers could be used to detect various defects such as memory
leaks and synchronisation errors or do some profiling regard to the program.

- Valgrind
- Callgrind
- Helgrind

## Call Tracers and Domain Specific Diagnostic Tools

To-do: elaborate more

- Strace
- WireShark (networking profiling and diagnosis)
- SQL analysis
- Ltrace

## ELF Reader

ELF stores the debug information on an executable program. The following tools
can be used to analyse the ELF information:

- `readelf -WS` to read information from ELF files.
- `strip` to remove symbols such as debug symbols from the object files.
- `objcopy`, like `strip` but allows more fine tune symbols removal.
- `objdump -j {object in ELF} -s` to show the particular section shown in
  `readelf` with all headers included.
- `dwarf-dump`

## Compiler Explorer

Compiler explorer could be used to investigate the underlying assembly output
from different compilers to analyse their output discrepancies. It is useful in
discovering compiler bugs and the [assumptions](202302121739.md) that it made.

## Unclassified/Others

- `debuginfod` for remote debugging.
- SystemTap as a scripting language to debug live running kernel.
- Simply print out the value of the variable using `print` function or GUI popup
- paper-and-pencil
- external plotting programs like `gnuplot`
