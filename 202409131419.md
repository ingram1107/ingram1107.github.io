# dpkg

dpkg is the base package management system for [Debian-based distro](202409131438.md),
same to its higher abstraction counterpart [APT](202409131439.md). The most
commonly used flags for the command are `-i` (install), `-r` (remove), `-P`
(purge, remove configuration files too), `-I` (get package information), and
`-L` (list files installed by specific package). `--get-selections
{optional-package-name-pattern}` lists all installed packages that match the
name pattern give, if any.

`dpkg-query -S` shows which package owns specific file.

`dpkg-reconfigure` restores package settings to its fresh state.
