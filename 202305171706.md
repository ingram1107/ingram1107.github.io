# Token Bucket Algorithm

Token bucket algorithm is one of the algorithms of [Traffic Shaping](202302201414.md)
focuses on the abstract token hold by the buffer, which is generated by a clock
every $\Delta t$ second. In contrast to [Leaky Bucket Algorithm](202305171656.md),
it allows the output rate to be dependent on token hold. The host has to capture
and destroy a token in order to transmit a packet. An idle host can capture and
save up tokens up to the maximum buffer size in order to deal with later
[Network Congestion](202209302043.md). This allows token bucket algorithm for
large bursts to be sent faster by speeding up the output.
