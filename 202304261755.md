# Network-Assisted Congestion Control

Network-assisted congestion control is a [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
method relying on the feedback of current congestion state from the network to
the source. The state may be illustrated by a single bit or complex information
like the transmission rate on the outgoing link that the affected
[Router](202207061800.md) can support. There are two implementations of
the feedback: direct feedback and network feedback. In direct feedback
mechanism, the router will send a choke packet to the source to indicate a
congestion occurrence. In network feedback, the router instead merely marks the
packet field to indicate that a congestion is happening. Once the packet reach
the destination, the received host will notify the source host, which ultimately
take a [Round-Trip Time (RTT)](202303292133.md).

Several network implementations such as IBM SNA, DECnet, and
[ATM](202209221012.md) Available Bit-Rate (ABR) adopt network-assisted
congestion control. There is a proposal (RFC 2481) to implement this method of
congestion control in [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md)
network.
