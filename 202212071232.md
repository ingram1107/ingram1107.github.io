# IPC Facilities Key

`key_t` key is a 32-bit identifier associated with an
#[Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md) object on a #unix system.
It can be obtained from the function `ftok()` imported from `sys/types.h` and
`sys/ipc.h` that maps a file's pathname and an 8-bit integer into a key. The
creation of key is shown as below:

```c
                  // pathname
key_t key = ftok("/tmp", 'S');
                         // 8-bit integer
```

Within the `ftok()`, `stat()` is called, and file system information where the
pathname specified, its inode number, and the 8-bit integer are combined to
produce a key.

If the flag passed to the IPC object [System Call](202210062303.md)
(#[Message Queue](202212071258.md), semaphore, and share memory) are `IPC_CREAT`
and `IPC_EXCL` (exclusive), there is an additional need to check against the
error number `EEXIST` which indicates that the IPC object has already existed.
If the flag is `IPC_CREAT`, the system call will return in success either the
key doesn't or does exist.

If duplication is undesired, we could use `IPC_PRIVATE` as the IPC key instead
so that it guarantees to create a unique IPC object.
