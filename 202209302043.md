# Network Congestion

Network Congestion is networking condition which could happen when there are too
many sources **sending too much** data **too fast** for network to handle. This
phenomenon could be observed when there are packet losses (due to buffer
overflow at [Routers](202207061800.md) and increasing end-to-end delays (due to
queuing in router buffers). The result is the unfairness and poor utilisation of
network resources due to resources used by dropped packets before they were
lost, [retransmissions](202206151232.md), and poor resource allocation at high
load.
