# Uniform I/O Driver Table

Within the uniform I/O driver table, each row represents a unique I/O driver,
with the columns specify which API set it supports. A generic name like "tty" is
used to associate a I/O driver with a particular type of device. Pointer that
associates between the generic function and the driver-specific function is
written to the table upon the installation of the driver in the [I/O Subsystem](202407012209.md).
Drivers can be removed or installed using I/O subsystem's utility functions.
