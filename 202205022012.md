# Biconnectivity

Biconnectivity is an attribute of a connected #[202204112129](202204112129.md) where removal of
a node will not disconnect the graph. We could say that an undirected graph is
biconnected if it satisfies this condition.

If there is a node where its removal will result in a disconnected undirected
graph, that node is an **articulation point** for that graph. The articulation
point in the graph could be found using #[202205021959](202205021959.md) alongside with
*spanning tree* that store back edges (there is a connection between $(v,w)$ but
it has been visited).
