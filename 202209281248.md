# One-Time Pad

One-Time Pad, or sometimes called One-Time [Vernam Cipher](202211061010.md)#, is
a #[Substitution Cryptographic](202209281136.md) #algorithm that uses a
single-use secret key for encrypting. It requires the key to be as long as the
plaintext and [random](202207162147.md). Thus, guarantees an [Unconditional Security](202209281242.md)#
to the ciphertext. However, it does face some security concerns over secure key
distribution and key generation for randomness. It is only used for low
bandwidth and very high security purposes.
