# Regex Back References

Back References or sometimes called groups could be created using `()` and later
be referred by `\{digit}` depending on the programming languages. Usually, the
whole matched pattern will be grouped as group 0.

## Vim

In Vim's regexp, we could refer to the group by using the syntax `\[0-9]`. The
maximum groups in a pattern is 10. There is no mechanism, at least from what I
know, to support more than 10 regexp groups.

## C++

Back references could be accessed via `regex_iterator` from `regex` object. From
there, we could iterate over the matched groups from the regex.

In order to not create a back reference, we could use the syntax `(?:)`.

## Rust

In order to get the back references from `Regex` object, we need to obtain a
`Capture` object from `Regex` method `captures`. From `Capture`, we use the
method `get` to get the particular group as a `Match` object.

**Note**: Remember to unwrap or map them to desirable type.
