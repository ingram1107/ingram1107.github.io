# Cookie

Cookie, defined by RFC 2109, is a technology to track user activity on a
website by giving the user a unique identifier. In [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md),
this can be done by setting the header `Set-cookie` to the unique identifier
generated from the user in the response message, in which the user HTTP request
message will always include the value in the header `Cookie`. This raises
concern over the fact that cookie is able to track the user's behaviours
especially if the user other information (e-mail, addresses etc.) are made
associated to the cookie. Ad companies use this fact and supply the banner ads
to multiple website where they build a profile on a user by tracking their
activities across different websites.
