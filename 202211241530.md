# Mediator Pattern

Mediator Pattern is a #[Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that encapsulates and
localise how a set of objects interact with each other, especially the
collective behaviour. A Mediator object can be seen as an intermediary between
objects or hub of communication where they interact with each other indirectly.
In this way, we could make changes to their behaviour independently without
increasing [coupling](202202041514.md)# between them. The reason is that with
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), we tend to have multiple objects that
interconnected to each other (dependencies), which cause a change in one might
affect others, thus the coupling between them can be too tight.

The Gang of Four advised to use Mediator Pattern when
1. Multiple objects communicate in well-defined but complicated (to be
   understandable) ways.
2. Reduction of reusuability of an object due to dependencies and communication
   to other objects.
3. A behaviour that's distributed between several classes should be customisable
   without tons of subclassing.

Unlike #[Observer Pattern](202211231132.md), Mediator object and its colleagues
(clients) know each other. Colleagues class will send and request services from
Mediator object in order to interact with other colleague which one may not know
about. Mediator object serves the request within its local scope and call the
cooperative behaviour by routing requests between the required colleagues. Of
course, the Mediator object needs to identify the colleague to search for the
appropriate action.

Mediator Pattern could also incorporate #[Observer Pattern](202211231132.md) to
implement [Publish/Subscribe Protocol](202207041109.md) as a communication
mechanism. Colleagues, implemented as subjects, will notify Mediator,
implemented as observer, in an event of interests where the Mediator object
calls other colleagues according.
