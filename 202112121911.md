# Splay Tree

Splay Tree is a #[202112121746](202112121746.md), like [202112121857](202112121857.md), that could balance
itself.

## Details

- See on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree#Splaying)

## Analysis

- It guarantees `M` of consecutive tree operations will only take $O(M \log N)$
  of time
- There will no bad input sequence in this Tree which will improve future
  operations
- This Tree will have a $O(\log N)$ amortised cost per operation
- The worst case time cost for all operations is $O(N)$ which is infrequent
- This Tree is simpler to program compare to [202112121857](202112121857.md)
