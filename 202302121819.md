# C Pointer Manipulation

In C, establishing relationships between different memory objects (i.e.,
comparing two pointers other than equality comparison) is not allowed. For this,
it is advised to turn the pointers, even after when they are exceeded their
lifetime, into integers for allowing comparison. However, be aware when turning
back into pointers. [^Hald2022]
