# Unix-to-Unix Copy (UUCP)

UUCP is a collection of programs operate as a single batch mode system (queue
works in a spool). The main component in UUCP is the program `uucico` which
communicates with each other at the end points and executes the tasks queued in
a spool. There are programs like `uucp` for file copying and `uux` for command
execution.
