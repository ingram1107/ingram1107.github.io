# Robustness Principles

Robustness principles focus on the level of support provided by the user in
determining successful achievement of goal-directed behaviour. It concerns on
the **observability** (ability of user to evaluate the system internal state
from perceiving representation), **recoverability** (take corrective action upon
errors), **responsiveness** (rate of #communication), and **task conformance**
(how much does the system support all the user's tasks).
