# Islam in India

The first Muslim rule in the [Indian world](202309061900.md) was established by
an Arab commander called Muhammad bin Qasim who conquered Daybul province and
later the whole kingdom of Sindh. Later, the city of Mansura was founded in
730. Muslim expansion continued in Punjab and Gujarat.

See other Muslim countries that reigned in India before:
- [Delhi Sultanate](202309061939.md)
- [Mughal Sultanate](202309062038.md)

Several magazines and books with huge influence from Islamic thoughts were established
such as al-Ma'arif, al-Hilal, Ta'mir Hayat, Tarikh-i-Muzaftarim, Ibrat-Nama,
Sair-ul-Mutakherin, and Imad-ur-Saadat. There are also translation of Ramayana,
Mahabharata, Bhagavata Purana, and Rajatarangini in Bengali and Persian.
