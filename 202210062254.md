# Kernel

Kernel is the innermost part of an operating system which performs functions
such as memory management, CPU scheduling, TCP/IP Networking drivers, process
administration and control over hardware. In a small and simple embedded system,
it may represent the entire [Real-Time System (RTS)](202403301908.md).

There are several kernel designs shown down below:
- [Polled Loop System](202404131853.md)
- [Polled Loop with Delay](202404131859.md)
- [Cyclic Code Structure](202404131912.md)
- [State-Driven Code](202404141411.md)
- [Co-Routines](202404141417.md)
