# RPM

RPM is the base package management system for [Red Hat Linux-based distro](202409131545.md),
the same with its higher abstraction like [YUM](202409131546.md),
[DNF](202409131555.md), and Zypper. The most commonly used flags for the command
are `-i` (install), `-U` (upgrade, install the package if it doesn't exist),
`-F` (upgrade only), `-e` (remove), `-qa` (query all installed packages), `-qi`
(package information), `-ql` (package contents), and `-qf` (find file owner).
Additional flags can be passed, including `-v` for verbose, `-h` to show
installation process in `#`, and `-p` for queries (`-q`) to do query operations
on packages (`.rpm`) that are not installed yet.
