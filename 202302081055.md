# Quake III Algorithm

Quake III is a fast inverse square root algorithm that utilises bit manipulation
and [Newton Method](202302081430.md) to [optimise](202203011139.md) the
approximation of inverse square root $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}$. Comparing to naive
implementation, it is 3 times faster with a result of at most 1% of error. The
algorithm is largely used for game physic engine especially on physic reflection
vector in order to scale down some variables.

## Details

By manipulating the [floating point bits](202302081452.md) through converting
them into `long` variable since bit manipulation is disallowed in floating
point, we can do bitwise operation on them. Based on the assumption that $\log
(1 + x) \approx x$ when $0 < x < 0.1$, we conclude that the bit representation
of a floating point value $f$ is approximately the same to $log(f)$. Thus, the
following formula:

$$
\begin{align}
\log (\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}) &= \log (y^{-\frac{1}{2}})\\
&= - \frac{1}{2} \log(y)
\end{align}
$$

The above calculation could be represented using bitwise left shift `- (y >> 1)`
since the logarithm is binary based. Now, assuming that $\Gamma =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{y}}$, applying the assumption from [Additional section](202302081452.md),
we thus arrive to the following conclusion:

$$
\begin{align}
\log(\Gamma) &= - \frac{1}{2} \log(y)\\
\frac{1}{2^{23}} (M_\Gamma + 2^{23}E) + \mu - 127 &= - \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{2^{23}} (M_y + 2^{23}E) + \mu - 127 \right]\\
\frac{1}{2^{23}} (M_\Gamma + 2^{23}E) &= 127 + \frac{127}{2} - \mu -
\frac{\mu}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{2^{23}} (M_y + 2^{23}E) \right]\\
M_\Gamma + 2^{23}E &= \frac{3}{2} 2^{23} (127 - \mu) - \frac{1}{2} (M_y +
2^{23}E)
\end{align}
$$

The result of $\frac{3}{2} 2^{23} (127 - \mu)$ is 5f3759df in hex. Combining
with the previous code, we reach a consensus that the approximate answer for
inverse square root of $y$ is `0x5f3759df - (y >> 1)`. To get more accurate
answer, we can use [Newton Method](202302081430.md) on the result using the
formula $0 = \frac{1}{y^2} - x$ which translate to code `y = y * (1.5 - (x2 * y y))`.
We could do one more iteration to get more accurate result, but it is
unnecessary in most of the cases.

## Implementation

```c
float Q_rsqrt (float number)
{
  long i;
  float x2, y;
  const float threeHalfs = 1.5F;

  x2 = number * 0.5F;
  y = number;
  i = *(long *) &y;   // convert to long to allow bit manipulation without
                      // affecting the floating point value
  i = 0x5f3759df - (i >> 1);
  y = *(float *) &i;  // revert to float
  y = y * (threeHalfs - (x2 * y * y));      // first iteration
  // y = y * (threeHalfs - (x2 * y * y));   // second iteration, can be removed

  return y;
}
```
