# P2P File Sharing with Peer's Heterogeneity Property

In this [Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing](202303081138.md) approach, it utilises
the inequality between peers in terms of bandwidth and Internet connectivity to
designate powerful peers as group leaders. These group leader will have up to a
few hundred children peers, and maintain a database that includes information
such as the identifiers of all the files its children are sharing (informed by
the children peers), file metadata, the children's [IP Address](202206281021.md)
etc. This is like [centralised directory](202303081142.md), but otherwise the
group leaders act like [Distributed Peers](202303081148.md) in the network
albeit with a hierarchy. KaZaA used this approach for file sharing.
