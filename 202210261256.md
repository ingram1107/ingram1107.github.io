# Binary Symmetric Channel

Binary Symmetric Channel is a #[Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC)](202210261202.md)
that both sizes of input alphabet $X$ and output alphabet $Y$ is 2, that is $j =
k = 2$. The probability of receiving 1 when a 0 is sent is the same probability
of receiving 0 when a 1 is sent, thus symmetric in nature.
