# Blowfish

Blowfish is a #[Block Cipher](202209281239.md) that has high execution speed and
runs in less than 5K of memory. It could have a key size up to 448 bits, and
used to encrypt a 64-bit data block. Blowfish will perform 16 rounds of
[round function](202210052211.md)#. It is comparatively easier to implement
compare to other cryptographic #algorithm.
