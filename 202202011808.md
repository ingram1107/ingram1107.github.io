# Limitation of Parallelism

Although parallelism is always the best solution for multithreading, there is
some situation that sharing resources is not possible.

Take the #[example](202202011649.md) from the Western family. Suppose that some of
you want to drink a wine which value $1000. It is impossible to let everyone
hold a bottle of wine for themselves which resulted that you all agree to share
the wine together. Even if you hold your own glass, the wine is still needed to
be shared.

In this situation, consider revalue the situation: either remove the wine or
apply concurrency startegy.
