# Data Authentication Algorithm (DAA)

DAA is one of the implementations of #[Message Authentication Code (MAC)](202212291225.md)
defined by FIPS PUB 113 and ANSI X9.17 which is based on
[Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)](202210071133.md)#. The initialisation value (IV)
used is 0 and the final block is padded by 0s, which is where the MAC derived
from. If the final block is too big, it will use the left most $M$ ($16 \le M
\le 64$) bits of the final block as the MAC.

The key and MAC sizes are too small to be considered secure though.
