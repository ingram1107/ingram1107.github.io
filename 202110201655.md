# Docker Compose

`docker-compose` could be used to run multiple #[202110201655](202110201655.md)
#[202203281423](202203281423.md) in a single Docker host using a YAML file. Name the following
YAML file as `docker-compose.yaml` or later use the option `-f` to import the
file:

```yaml
version: 2
services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    networks:
      - back-end
  db:
    image: postdres:9.4
    networks:
      - back-end
  vote:
    build: ./vote
    ports:
      - 5000:80
    depends_on:
      - redis
    networks:
      - front-end
      - back-end
  result:
    build: ./result
    ports:
      - 5001:80
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - front-end
      - back-end
  worker:
    build: ./worker
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
    networks:
      - back-end

networks:
  front-end:
  back-end:
```

Run `docker-compose up` to bring up the set-up specified in the YAML file.

Since version 2, `docker-compose` can automatically set up a bridge network
where all containers specified in the YAML file to be connected. Therefore, the
option `--link` used in `docker run` is rendered as unnecessary. You could still
establish dependencies between different containers with the option
`depends_on`.

If the container need to be built from a local directory instead of a
[202203251430](202203251430.md), use the `build` option instead of `image`.

We could establish our own custom networks by using the `networks` option
attached to the container. Make sure that those networks had been named at the
top most level.
