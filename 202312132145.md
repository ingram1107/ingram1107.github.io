# Java Native Interface (JNI)

JNI is a programming framework that is part of the Java Developer Kit (JDK)
which allows [Integrative Programming](202311041150.md), meaning that Java may
interoperate with native applications and libraries written in other programming
language. That being said, it sacrifices the benefit of JVM being cross-platform
and instead becoming platform dependent, and runtime debugging becomes more
difficult.

JNI can load the native method implementation (declaration defined in Java
source code) from other library with the following Java and, in this case,
[C++](202302190651.md) codes:

```java
class Happy {
    public native void printText();

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("happy");
    }

    public static void method (String[] args) {
        Happy p1 = new Happy();
        p1.printText();
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iosteram>
#include "Happy.h"

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Happy_printText(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) {
    std::cout << "Happy New Year!\n";
    return;
}
```

**Note**: `JNIEnv` lets the C or C++ file to have access to all JNI functions.
`jobject` on the other hand refers to `this` Java object created in the Java
source file.

Primitive types in Java don't need conversion when implemented in native codes.
In contrast, object types such as string, class, array, and throwable have to be
converted from either way. String (`jstring`) can be converted to C-string by
the functions `GetStringChars()` or `GetStringUTFChars()` and must be released
by the corresponding `Release` functions. Declaring a new string can be done by
`NewString()` or `NewStringUTF()`. We can get the string's length with the
functions `GetStringLength()` or `GetStringUTFLength()`. Accessing a primitive
type array can be done via getting a direct pointer to the array
(`Get{Type}ArrayElements()`) or copying it as a native array
(`Get{Type}ArrayRegion()` with the parameters of the source array, starting
index, number of elements to be copied, and native buffer). If we access the
array with a pointer, then we have to release the resource by calling
`Release{Type}ArrayElements()` and pass the original array, the array pointer,
and option (0 to copy back and free the resource, `JNI_COMMIT` to copy back
only, or `JNI_ABORT` to free the resource only). To update the copied array's
content back to the original source, we have to call `Set{Type}ArrayRegion()`
with the parameters similar to `Get{Type}ArrayRegion()`. We can get the array
length with the function `GetArrayLength()`. For object array, in order to gain
access to the array, we have to know the class of the object (`FindClass()`),
and then create a new object array from it (`NewObjectArray()` with the
parameters of array length, object class, and initial element). Getting and
setting object array element can be done with the functions
`GetObjectArrayElement()` and `SetObjectArrayElement()`.

When trying to access information stored in an object, we have to gain a
reference to the object's class in order to get the field values or call the
method. To do this, we can utilise the function `GetObjectClass()` from the
class `JNIEnv`, which is named as `env` above. To gain access to field, we need
a field identifier referring to the field based on its name and data type. We
call `GetFieldID()` and pass in the parameter of the class reference, the field
name, and its data type descriptor. The data type descriptor is a string to
symbolise the data type of the field that we want to retrieve, there are various
field descriptors as shown in the table below. From now on, we can retrieve
(`Get{Type}Field()`) and modify (`Set{Type}Field()`) the field based on the
field data type, as shown by the code below:

```cpp
jclass cls = env->GetObjectClass(obj);
jfieldID fid = env->GetFieldID(cls, "code", "I");
jint num = env->GetIntField(obj, fid);
env->SetIntField(obj, fid, num);
```

Java Type | Field Descriptor
---|---
boolean | `Z`
byte | `B`
char | `C`
short | `S`
int | `I`
long | `J`
float | `F`
double | `D`
String | `Ljava/lang/String;`
Object | `Ljava/lang/Object;`
int[] | `[I`

**Note**: When dealing with static field, since the static field is stored
within the class itself instead of stored individually inside each object, the
value retrieval (`GetStatic{Type}Field()`) and modification
(`SetStatic{Type}Field()`) is done in the class scope. Therefore, the first
parameter passed to the methods has to be the class reference itself. Otherwise,
the procedure is similar to the instance field's as shown above other than a
little name change (`GetStaticFieldID()`).

Similar to field accessing, to call a method, we need to the method identifier
by calling `GetMethodID()` and pass in the parameter of the class reference, the
method's name, and its method descriptor. The method descriptor follows the
format of `({params-data-type}){return-type}`. For example, `(II)D` refers to a
method that accepts two `int` type parameter and returns `double`. For more
descriptor options, refer to the field descriptor table described above. Then,
we can call the method with `Call{Type}Method()` and pass in the object and the
method identifier.

**Note**: Calling static methods in JNI can be done by adding the keyword
`Static` to the corresponding functions like in accessing static field. Remember
that static methods have to be accessed from class scope.

**Note**: Additionally, void return type function has a method descriptor of
`V`.
