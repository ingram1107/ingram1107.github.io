# Common Unix Printing System (CUPS)

CUPS is a widely-adopted printing system for Unix-like operating system
including #[Linux](202205301557.md). It manages *print queues* in the local
machine and can act as a client to pass those printing jobs to remote computers
that works with the same underlying network printing protocol, [202205301808](202205301808.md)#
(alternatives are SMB/CIFS and LPD).

All configuration files are stored inside the directory `/etc/cups/`. The file
`cups.conf` contains lots of configuration options such as `Browsing` (enable
*browsing* feature) and `BrowsingAddress` (where the browsing information should
be sent and broadcasted). `printers.conf` on the other hand consists of printer
definitions where additional options are further stored inside the directory
`/etc/cups/ppd` with the format of [202205301819](202205301819.md)#.

**Note**: It is advised to just rely on the web-based utilities provided by CUPS
package instead of manually editing the files unless you need to configure the
web-based tool itself or the ability of CUPS to interface to other CUPS.

CUPS has its own set of smart filters that fit [202205301606](202205301606.md)# into the *print
queue* which is especially useful in non-PostScript printer.

It has several programs such as `lpr`, `lpq`, `lprm` and `lpc` that help it on
*print queues* management. All programs mentioned accepts the option `-P` where
you can indicate which print queue should the program operate on.

The CLI tool `lpr` is particularly useful in #[202205301557](202205301557.md). The files to be
printed usually submitted into the directory `/var/spool/cups/` by the tool.

`lpq` can be used to display important print queue information such as number of
files contained, file size, file owner, job number and so on.

The program `lprm` can removes job(s) depending on the syntax give. If it is
passed with a number, it will treat that number as the job number of the job to
be deleted. If a dash `-` is passed instead, the command will remove all the
jobs related to the current user (for root user, it may remove all jobs).

`lpc` is used to control print queue.

**Note**: Use web interface instead for controlling the print queue.
