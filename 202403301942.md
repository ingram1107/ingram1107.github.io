# Clock-Based Real-Time System

Clock-based [Real-Time System (RTS)](202403301908.md) synchronises external
processes and internal actions or tasks in a computer in the terms of passage of
time or the actual time of day. The synchronisation is typically obtained by
adding a clock (thus the name) to the system. The clock signal will then be
produced to interrupt the operation at predetermined fixed time interval.

Clock-based operations could be either **cyclic** or **periodic**. A cyclic
clock-based operation means that there is a fix time interval and the timing is
critical. As such, the task will be performed in a regular interval. Periodic
clock-based operation, on the other hand, will be triggered at a specific time,
in which the time between its execution is fixed. It is not as critical in
timing sense as in cyclic counterpart.
