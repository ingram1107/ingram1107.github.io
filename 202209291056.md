# Discrete Memoryless Source (DMS)

The definition of DMS is [Discrete Information Source](202210042219.md)#.

In DMS, new symbol produced is independent of the previous one as they couldn't
establish the relationship if the system can't remember them.

To calculate the total amount of #[Information](202209291015.md) for a source,
sum up all the information from the symbols.

$$
\begin{align}
I(s_k s_i) = I(s_k) + I(s_i)
\end{align}
$$

Due to the nature of relatively independence of the symbol produced by DMS, if
the symbols are transmitted in blocks, then we could expect the
#[Entropy](202209291005.md) of $S^n$ is equal to $n$ times of entropy of $S$.

$$
H(S^n) = nH(S)
$$
