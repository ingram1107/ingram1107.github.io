# Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)

RSVP is a [Transport Layer](202206131837.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md)
attempting to reserve resources across a network, which could be used to deliver
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md). Each [Router](202207061800.md)
passes the request to the next router in line and eventually reaches at the
destination for its agreement. A flow identifier is generated and returned upon
the honour of the request for each hop. For support of [dynamic traffic engineering](202305040730.md),
there is [RSVP with Traffic Engineering Extensions (RSVP-TE)](202305040735.md)
