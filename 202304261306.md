# Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)

RSVP is a [Transport Layer](202206131837.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md)
attempting to reserve resources across a network, which could be used to
deliver [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md).

RSVP with Traffic Engineering Extensions (RSVP-TE) is an extension to RSVP to
support [Label Distribution](202304261259.md) by the means of piggybacking the
exchange of labels.
