# Packet Exchange Protocol (PEX)

PEX is an unreliable, connectionless, datagram protocol in
[Xeros Network Systems (XNS)](202303021149.md) operates in [Transport Layer](202206131837.md).
Similar to [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md), but it retransmits
request based on timeout and can't detect duplication.

Its 6-byte header contains a 32-bit ID field (must be unique for each request)
and a 16-bit client type (the type of service requested).
