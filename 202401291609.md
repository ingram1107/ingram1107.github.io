# Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

RMI allows an object running in a Java virtual machine to invoke methods on
another object running on another Java virtual machine. This establishes remote
communication between Java processes. It composes of client, server, and remote
object. The server is used to create remote objects, make references to them
accessible, and waits clients for the method invocation.

`rmiregistry`, a simple naming facility, is used to locate the remote object.
