# Polled Loop System

Polled Loop System is a [Real Time](202403301908.md) [Kernel](202210062254.md)
in which the system keeps polling the test flag status to determine whether an
event has occurred. There is no requirement on [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md)
or scheduling since there is only a single task. It works well in a single
processor system that is dedicated to handling I/O for same fast device or
overlapping of events that is not allowed or kept to a minimum.

The following code shows its typical code structure:
```c
for (;;;) {
    if (test_flag) {
        do_task();
        test_flag = 0;
    }
}
```

Due to its rather simple code structure, a polled loop system is simple to write
and debug, and its response time is easy to determine. It is pretty great at
handling high-speed data channels, events occur at widely dispersed intervals,
or dedicated processor for fast device. However, it is prone to failure since it
can't withstand bursting events, and is insufficient on handling complex
systems. Polling is essentially a CPU-heavy approach to check event occurrence.
