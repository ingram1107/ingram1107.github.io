# traceback

`traceback` is a Python object which provides standard interface to extract, format and print the stack traces similar to the Python interpreter. [^pythondoc2022]

It exposes functions such as `print_tb` (print stack trace entries), `print_stack` (almost the same to `print_tb`), `extract_tb` (return `StackSummary` object that contain a list of `FrameSummary` object), `extract_stack` (same as `extract_tb`), `format_tb` (return a list of strings processed based on the `extract_tb` output) and `format_stack` (same as `format_tb` but dealing with `extract_stack` instead).

`FrameSummary` object is representing a ready to print information for stack trace. It includes data such as file name, line number, name, line and variable representation.
