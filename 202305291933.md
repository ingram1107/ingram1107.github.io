# Acceptance Testing

Acceptance testing or validation testing is a [test case](202206201159.md) to
validate whether the product has met the customer's needs and expectations. In
contrast to other testing practice, customers are the one to do the testing and
define test cases like in [Usability Testing](202206201428.md). *Benchmark
testing* can be conducted by the customer by preparing a set of test cases that
represent typical conditions under which the product will operate when actually
installed, and then evaluate its #performance for each test case.

Acceptance testing can be conducted in two phases: *alpha* and *beta testing*.
The alpha testing is conducted at the developer's site where the software is
used in a natural setting with developer accompany the user and record down the
errors and usage problems encountered by the user. Beta testing, however, is
conducted at the customer sites by the end-user of the #software with no
developer presence.
