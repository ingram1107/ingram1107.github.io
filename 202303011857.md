# SQL Transaction Control

[Structured Query Language (SQL)](202302231241.md) provides facility for
transaction control in case of system failure while in the process of
[Database](202302101139.md) modification. This makes transaction *atomic*, as
the database will not enter an undetermined state. Two statements are primarily
important in playing the role of controlling transaction control: `commit work`
and `rollback work`.

`commit work` commits the current transaction, that is making the database
modification permanent and unable to be undone by `rollback work`. In contrast,
`rollback work` undoes the current transaction, making the database going back
to its previous state. The [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md)
guarantee that if a transaction has not yet executed `commit work`, it will be
rollback with `rollback work`. This works fantastically if there is unexpected
system crash during a transaction, which could be otherwise making inconsistent
changes across the database.

If we want to make multiple SQL statement as a single atomic operation, we can
use the clause `begin aotmic {statements} end`. All the statements within the
clause is guarantee to be atomic, that is, they are either committed to the
database or being rollbacked.
