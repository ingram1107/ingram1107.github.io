# Data Link Layer

Data Link layer is the second layer for #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
It is referred as Link Layer together with [Physical Layer](202206131647.md) in
#[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md). Its responsibility is to
establish a communication session between two different devices at node level
regardless of network types. It will [encapsulate](202210012046.md)# the data
with a header that includes the information about the protocol used and the
source and destination [Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md)#.
All Ethernet switching and bridging are done here. Its
#[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)# is a *frame*.

Some protocols operate at this layer, shown as follows:
- [Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)](202207081637.md)#
- [Ethernet](202207051550.md)#
- [Frame Relay](202208291308.md)#
- [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)#
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)#
- [Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)](202211051036.md)#
- [Fibre-Channel](202302131547.md)
- [Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)](202304220943.md)
- [Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)](202408122255.md)

Some operating systems provide interfaces to interact with Data Link Layer to
ease the programmers' effort on network programming. These are shown at below:
- [BSD Packet Filter (BPF)](202209301046.md)#
- [Datalink Provider Interface (DLPI)](202209301047.md)#
