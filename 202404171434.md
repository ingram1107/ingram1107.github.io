# Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

PCM is an audio encoding method typically used in [Voice over IP (VoIP)](202303201850.md).
It digitises analogue audio so that it could be carried by other protocol like
[Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)](202304092140.md). PCM process involves
**sampling**, **quantisation**, and **encoding**.

The resulting sampling frequency is typically 2 times larger than the source
audio frequency. For example, the average frequency of human voice fall under
3.2 kHz, thus the sampling frequency should be 6.4 kHz.
