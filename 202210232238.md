# Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) Problem

CDH Problem states that given $(g, g^x \mod p, g^y \mod p)$, find $g^{xy} \mod
p$. Based on the CDH assumption, it is generally a hard problem to solve (other
than being solved by [Discrete Logarithms (DLOG)](202210232232.md)#). Many
[asymmetric cryptographic scheme](202203221212.md) depends on CDH security
guarantee.
