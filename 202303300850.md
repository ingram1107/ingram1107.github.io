# Wireless Local Loop (WLL)

WLL aka Radio in the Loop (RITL), Fixed-Radio Access (FRA), or Fixed-Wireless
Access (FMA) is a set of [wireless cellular technologies](202303292214.md) that uses
[wireless communication link](202302161842.md) to deliver plain old telephone
service (POTS) or Internet access to end points for the last mile connections.
Several cellular technologies such as [Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)](202303302113.md),
[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](202304111937.md), IS-136, and
[analogue access technologies](202303311218.md) can be used in conjunction with
the appropriate devices, called Fixed Wireless Terminals (FWT) units, to
implement WLL.

FWT units differ from the mainstream mobile terminal units such that a fixed
wireless terminal or desk-phone will be limited to an almost permanent location,
thus no [roaming](202303021542.md) services, and almost no location tracking
facilities.
