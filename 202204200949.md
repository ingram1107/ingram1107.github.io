# Dijkstra's Algorithm with Vertex Selection Rule

#[202204151059](202204151059.md) could be used alongside with vertex selection rule, that is to
select vertices in [topological order](202204112136.md)# which in turn they will
be declared known. It is useful on dealing with known
#[directed acyclic graph](202204112118.md).

It could be applied to solve:
- modeling of non-reversible chemical reactions
- [202204200956](202204200956.md)

## Analysis

- It will result in $\O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert)
