# Introduction in Dutch

To introduce [yourself](202205102304.md)#, you could say "*Ik ben Ingram*", "*Ik
heet Ingram*" or "*Mijn naam is Ingram"*. The first means "I am Ingram", the
second "I have been called Ingram" (similar to German *heissen*), and the third
"My name is Ingram".

To know how to call someone, you can ask "*Wie ben jij?*" (spell "yaen") or
"*Wie ben je?*" in informal situation and "*Wie bent u?*" in formal
conversation. You could also ask "*Hoe heet jij/je/u?*" or "*Wat is jouw/je/uw
naam?*". The first variation roughly means "Who are you?", the second means "How
to call you?", and the third "What is your name?".

Saying "Nice to meet you!" in Dutch, say "*Leuk om kennis met je/u te maken!*"
or "*Leuk om je/u te ontmoeten!*" if you prefer it short.

To ask where does one come from, you could ask "*Waar [kom je]/[komt u]
vandaan?*", meaning "Where do you come from?". Upon answering question, you can
say "*Ik kom uit MaleisiÃ«.*" which means "I come from Malaysia."

To ask where does one live in, you can ask "*Waar [woon jij]/[woont u] nu?*".
This means "Where do you live now?" Now, you could answer it as "*Ik woon in
Johor, dichtbij de rivier.*" which is equivalent to "I live in Johor, near the
river."

You can tell people how old are you by saing "Ik ben
[drieentwintig](202302222012.md)", meaning "I am twenty-three-year-old".
