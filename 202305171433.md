# Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP)

WDP is a connectionless [Transport Layer](202206131837.md)
[Protocol](202209302229.md) functions like [UDP](202206151759.md). It provides a
common interface to the upper layer protocols and adapts the transport layer to
specific features of the underlying browser to achieve global interoperability
where the upper layer protocols can function independently. Its specification
lists the [bearers](202303292214.md) that are supported and the techniques used
to allow [WAP](202302161711.md) to run over each bearer.
