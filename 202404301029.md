# Time-Relative Buffering

Time-relative buffering, aka double buffering or ping-pong buffering, provides a
buffer in which only one writer or reader can write to or read from it at a
time. It is typically deployed if time-relative data need to be transferred
between tasks of different rates or a full set of data is needed by one task but
can only be supplied slowly by another task. It could be one of the solution to
[Producer-Consumer Problem](202201301240.md).

Examples of applications are telemetry systems, graphical interfaces, navigation
equipment, elevator control systems, and screen display.
