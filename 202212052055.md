# Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS is an upgrade over #[Secure Socket Layer (SSL)](202212052009.md) version 3
(SSLv3) defined in RFC 5246. It has now been widely adopted as it is more secure
and efficient than its predecessor in *message authentication*, *key material
generation* and *supported cipher suites*. It uses the same record format and
MAC generation algorithm, HMAC, as SSLv3. That being said, the algorithm XORs
the padding bytes with the secret key padded to the block length instead of
concatenated with the secret key as in SSLv3. Furthermore, the MAC calculation
also including the field `TLSCompressed.version` which defined the protocol
version being used.

Other differences with SSL are:
- a [pseudo-random](202207162147.md) function expands secrets into blocks of
  data
- has additional alert codes
- changes in supported ciphers
- changes in certificate types and negotiations for
  [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)# and DSS
- changes in structure of Cerfificate_Verify and Finished messages
- changes in crypto computations and padding
