# Enterprise Integration Remote Procedure Invocation

Remote procedure invocation is an [Enterprise Integration](202305011106.md) by
having the applications to expose some of their procedures so that they can be
[invoked remotely](202302161128.md) [asynchronously](202304281232.md). Other
applications can invoke those functions to initiate desired behaviour and data
exchange.
