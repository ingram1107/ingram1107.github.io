# Generator Polynomial

Generator Polynomial $g(D)$ is equivalent to the [Generator Matrix](202211050947.md)
in [Linear Block Coding](202211041839.md) sense. Its degree is equal to the
number of parity bits in the code which is $n-k$. It is unique as it is the only
code word polynomial of minimum degree $n-k$, and any multiplication done on it
is a #[Code Word Polynomial](202212201759.md).

Its property can be stated mathematically as below:

$$
\begin{align}
g(D) &= 1 + \sum^{n-k-1}_{i=1} g_i D^i + D^{n-k}\\
x(D) &= a(D) g(D) \mod (D^n + 1)
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $D$ is an arbitrary real variable (see #[Code Word Polynomial](202212201759.md))
- $x(D)$ is #[the cyclic code word polynomial](202212192231.md)
- $a(D)$ is a polynomial in $D$
