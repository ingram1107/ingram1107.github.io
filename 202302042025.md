# Interface Inheritance/Subtyping

Interface Inheritance or Subtyping is a kind of [Object-Oriented Programming](202202041514.md)
inheritance that describes when an object can be used in place of another. Don't
confuse it with [Class Inheritance](202302042023.md) as the interface doesn't
have concrete implementation unlike in class inheritance. In #cpp, we could
implement it with pure abstract class.

> Program to an interface, not an implementation[^1]

There are several advantages implementing Subtyping. First, the clients remain
unaware of the specific types of objects they requested, as long as the objects
inherits interface that clients expect. Second, the clients remain unaware of
the classes that implement these objects as they only know the abstract classes
defining the interface. This in turns reduce implementation dependencies between
subsystems, thus enhance the reusuability of the modules.
