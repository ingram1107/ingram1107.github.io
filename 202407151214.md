# Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA)

RMA is a [schedulability analytical method](202407151211.md) based on
[Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)](202404141555.md) mechanism for [Real-Time System (RTS)](202403301908.md).
This means that the higher the execution frequency is for a task, the higher the
priority it should be.

RMA assumes all tasks are periodic and independent of each other and have the
same level of criticality. Task's deadline is counted as the beginning of its
next period, and each task has a fixed, constant execution time. Aperiodic tasks
are limited to initialisation and failure recovery work, and they don't have
hard deadlines.
