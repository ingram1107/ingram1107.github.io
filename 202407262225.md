# TLB Access Optimisation

Optimising access to [Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)](202403210922.md) can
be done by reducing the number of used pages by the program and the number of
allocated higher level directory tables. The first approach reduces TLB misses,
which if not handle properly can be progressively expensive, and page faults.
The second approach can be difficult though, as the number of allocated higher
level directory tables is based on the address ranges distribution used in the
virtual address space of a process. This means that one have to turn off
[Address Space Layout Randomisation (ASLR)](202407262234.md), trading off
security with insignificant cost improvement, which might not be worth it.
