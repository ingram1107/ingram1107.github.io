# Compile Time Type Determination

We could decide whether we should execute or enable a section of codes based on
circumstances. C++ standard libraries provides various ways to support this
prior to C++20. In C++20, there is no need for it because of [202203281200](202203281200.md)#.

## enable_if (C++11 and later)

To use `enable_if`, import it from the library `<type_traits>`. It is useful
especially when dealing with classes where in some cases there is no general
need of a function except for a particular type. The following shows such
example:

```cpp
template<typename T>
class Smart_pointer {
  // ...
  T& operator*();
  std::enable_if<is_class<T>(), T&> operator->();
}
```

The `*` operator could be used for variety of types without restriction.
However, in order to use the operator `->`, the type `T` has to be a class,
specified from the #[type predicate](202204181611.md) `is_class`.

As you can see, the first template parameter of enable_if is the *type
predicate*, and the second template parameter will be the *return type* of the
function. Thus, the statement will be parsed as `T& operator->()` if and only if
`T` is a class.

## Compile-Time if (C++17 and later)

When there is a need to execute a section of codes only when the type has met
#[some characteristics](202204181611.md), compile-time `if` could be in great use.
See the following examples:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void update(T& target)
{
  // ...
  if constexpr (is_pod<T>::value) { // is_pod is from <type_traits>
    simple_and_fast(target);
  } else {
    slow_and_safe(target);
  }
  // ...
}
```

If `T` is of `pod` type, that is of plain old data type, then the function
`update` will run the function `simple_and_fast` on the `target` variable.
Otherwise, it will run the function `slow_and_safe`.
