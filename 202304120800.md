# Jitter Buffer

Jitter buffer is a receiving end's buffer to buffer multimedia data and delay
playback. This is done by maintaining a list of data items ordered by timestamps
on the receiver. Before playback, the receiver delays for $d$ time units,
meaning the data being played is **$d$ time units behind** the data that is
arriving. This stage is particularly important as it forms the foundation of
smooth playback of the multimedia data. The contents of the packet are placed in
the buffer if it is delayed less than $d$ time units. In other words, the items
are inserted into the jitter buffer with some variation in rate. Finally, the
playback process retrieves the data from the buffer at a fixed rate.
