# Hybrid Key Distribution

Hybrid Key Distribution is an #[Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md) used
for #[master key distribution](202210062203.md) by relying on
[Key Distribution Center (KDC)](202210062220.md)#. It has a better performance
and is [backward compatible](202210131013.md).

There will be *three keys* used in this scheme: public key, master key and
session key. Each user will share the same secret master key, which is
distributed by public key (that is encrypted using public key when
distributing). Session key, which is the secret key itself, will be distributed
using the master key.
