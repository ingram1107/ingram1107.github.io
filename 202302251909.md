# Resource Record (RR)

RR is a four-tuple that provides hostname-to-[IP Address](202206281021.md)
translation with the following format:

```
(Name, Value, Type, TTL)
```

TTL defines the lifetime of the record and when it should be removed from
#caching maintained by the [Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md).
Depending on the Type, the meaning of Name and Value can be deferred. The
following table shows their corresponding possible values:

| Type  | Name           | Value                                                                         |
| ---   | ---            | ---                                                                           |
| A     | hostname       | IP address                                                                    |
| NS    | domain         | hostname of an authoritative DNS that can obtain the IP address of the domain |
| CNAME | alias hostname | canonical hostname                                                            |
| MX    | alias hostname | conanical name of a mail server                                               |
