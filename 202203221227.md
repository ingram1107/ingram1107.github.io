# SSH Tunnelling

#[Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md) could be used to tunnel insecure
#[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md) connections such as
[File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](202210221515.md) or IMAP if the configuration
`AllowTcpForwarding` is enabled. This provides a secure layer onto the TCP
connection without resort to displacing such protocol within a network.

One could run the command below in order to experience this feature:

```bash
sudo ssh -N -f -L 142:mail.luna.edu:143 benf@mail.luna.edu
```

`-N` option indicates that SSH should not execute remote command. `-f` option
requests SSH to go to background just after asking for passphrase. These two
options are used in order to establish a tunnel.

`-L` specifies the connections to a given TCP port on the local host that is to
be forwarded by the remote host.

`-X` or `-Y` could be used to tunnel the #[X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)](202205182136.md).
The first is usually the more secure option than the latter except in case of
[Debian][1]. You can change the default behaviour of SSH by modifying
[SSH Configuration](202205191924.md) where you can omit the option.
