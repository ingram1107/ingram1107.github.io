# Mach's Message's Structure

Mach's Message's structure might look like as following:
- Fix-length header
- Variable-length data section

**Note**: In Version 2.5, there is an 8 KB size limit on the data section.
However, such limitation had been lifted by Version 3.0.

The fix-length header will contain the following information:
- *the destination's port name*
- *the reply port name* where reply messages should be sent
- *the length of the message*

In the data section, there could be a variety of typed data objects being
stored, such as simple type (numbers or characters), port rights, pointers to
out-of-line data.
