# Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

SLAAC uses [ICMPv6](202209270927.md) [Router](202207061800.md) Solicitation and
Router Advertisement (sending prefix, prefix length etc.) to provide necessary
information for the client to generate [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md) and other
configuration information. It is aimed to replace the convention
[DHCP](202206151645.md) server.

There are three options for Router Advertisement:
- SLAAC only.
- Stateless DHCP where the router only provides partial information and the
  rest should be contacted from a DHCPv6 server.
- Stateful DHCP where the client must contact a DHCPv6 server.

Stateless DHCP can be enabled in a [Cisco](202210012232.md) router with the
command `ipv6 nd other-config-flag` in the interface configuration mode. For
stateful DHCP, we can enable it with the command `ipv6 nd managed-config-flag`
in the interface configuration mode.
