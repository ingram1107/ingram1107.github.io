# Conceptual Model

Conceptual model is a high-level description of how a [System](202303242148.md)
is organised and operates. In other words, it describes what system is going to
be or appear to the users (how will they understand it). A conceptual model
consists of major [metaphors and analogies](202304161003.md), concepts (expose
to users through the product), relationships between concepts, and mappings
between concepts and [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md).

It outlines the concepts and relationships between user interfaces and provides
a framework of general concepts and their interrelations. System designer
typically use conceptual model to organise their thinking before laying out
details. Note that the conceptual model must adhere or relate to the final
product.

Conceptual model forces the developers asking question on how it will be
understood by the users, avoiding tunnel vision, establishing common terms, and
reducing misunderstandings and confusions later on.
