# Template Method Pattern

Template method pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) where a method
defines an #algorithm's skeleton in which the steps could be implemented or
changed by the subclasses. This is done by having the abstract class to define
abstract primitive operations that act as part of the skeleton of the template
method.

**Note**: Other possible part of template method can be concrete operations,
[Factory Method](202302232101.md), and hook operations. Hook operation refers to
an operation that provides default behaviour, which can be doing nothing, where
the subclasses may extend if needed.

The Gang of Four advised to use the template method if:
1. The invariant parts of the algorithm have been implemented and the rest can
   be left up to the subclasses.
2. The common behaviours among subclasses should be [factored](202206032059.md)
   and localised in order to reduce [duplication](202206171004.md).
3. There is a need to control subclasses' extensions by hook operation.

They also warned that the number of primitive operations should be
**minimised** so that things would not get tedious for the client.

Template method can be used alongside with [Strategy Pattern](202302172008.md).
