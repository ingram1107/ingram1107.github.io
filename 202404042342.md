# KVM Virtualisation Model

KVM virtualisation model, deployed by [Linux](202204081225.md), delegates memory
handling to the #operating-system itself for the guest kernels. Hypervisor or
VMM is run as a user-level process to control virtualisation. Thus, unlike
[Xen Virtualisation Model](202404042325.md), there is no duplication of the
memory management implementation.
