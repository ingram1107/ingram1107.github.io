# Scavenger QoS

Scavenger QoS imposes a traffic limit on ports, and if the packets exceeding the
limits, it will be marked to lower priority, and might be dropped eventually. If
we know an application's normal behaviour on a device and on the network, a
[safeguard](202209261402.md) could be built using Scavenger QoS to recognise and
stop the application upon abnormal behaviours. It works in the opposite way of
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)#. It reduces [Network Congestion](202209302043.md)
and possible [DDoS](202209262115.md) or worm attacks especially if the attacks
create a traffic spike (exceeding bandwidth thresholds) for sustained periods.
