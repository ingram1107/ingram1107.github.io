# Cookie

Cookie is a small text file (around 4 KB) stored in the user's computer to
manage user sessions, identify user (for personalisation), and track user's
information and behaviours.

## PHP

We can set cookie via `setcookie()` function with mandatory parameter of the
cookie's name and optional parameters of cookie's value, expired date in UNIX
timestamp format, path on the server in which the cookie will be available on,
[domain](202209300947.md), `secure` (if set, allows only in
[HTTPS](202202211439.md)), and `httponly` (if set, allows only in HTTP only).
Later, we can check whether if the cookie is set by `isset()`. The following
codes illustrate the use of the function:

```php
// set cookie that expires after 30 days (30 days * 24 hours * 60 mins * 60 sec
setcookie("username", "Ingram", time()+30*24*60*60);

// delete the cookie by immediately expires it with past date
setcookie("username", "", time()-3600);
```

After setting the cookie, we gain access to the cookie on the server side with
the `_COOKIE` global variable of type array stored with the key of the cookies'
name.
