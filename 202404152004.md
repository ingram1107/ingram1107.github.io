# Compiler Stream Intrinsics

Stream [intrinsics](202404151959.md) load data from and written them back to
memory, bypassing [CPU Cache](202403191017.md). They are particularly useful in
processing large amount of data in one go. Note that all of these stream
intrinsics are [non-temporal](202407120728.md) in nature, meaning the data will
not be reused soon. Examples of these intrinsics are `__mm_stream_si32`,
`__mm_stream_si128`, `__mm_stream_pd`, `__mm_stream_pi`, `__mm_stream_ps`,
`__mm_stream_sd`, and `__mm_stream_ss`. They are in contrast to `__mm_store_{}`
alternative.
