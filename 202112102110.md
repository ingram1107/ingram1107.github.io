# Binary Tree

Binary Tree is a #[202112101956](202112101956.md) where every node could have at most 2
children.

## Analysis

- The average depth of one binary tree is $O(\sqrt[]{N})$

## Attention

- Many of the rules apply to [202110191729](202110191729.md) will apply to this data structure as well
- Avoid sorted input

## Implementation

```c
typedef struct TreeNode *PtrToNode;
typedef strcut PtrToNode Tree;

struct TreeNode {
  ElementType Element;
  Tree        Left;
  Tree        Right;
};
```
