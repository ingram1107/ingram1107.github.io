# Cellular Network Security

In [Cellular Network](202303292214.md), it is important to protect call setup,
transmitted data and speech, user location (cell ID,
[VLR](202303312030.md)/[HLR](202303312031.md) records), calling pattern, and
user ID.

The security of cellular network has evolved over time in order to meet any
challenge from emerging technologies. During [First-Generation Cellular Network (1G)](202303311218.md)
and [Second-Generation Cellular Network (2G)](202303311222.md), cellular
network's security was solely depends on SIM card's security support. In
[Second and A Half Generation Cellular Network (2.5G)](202303311226.md) and
[Third-Generation Cellular Network (3G)](202303311227.md), additional security
features has been added, including safe application downloading,
[Virtual Private Network (VPN)](202207150909.md), [cryptographic algorithms](202209281121.md),
secure [sockets](202202172152.md), data synchronisation, personal information
management, messaging, safe user-level application execution like Java Runtime,
and basic support coming from OS. Contemporary cellular network works on
hardware security and standards (Trusted Computing Group), securing local and
transmitted data and user ID, distributed middleware and ubiquitous computing
that is runtime configurable and upgradable, faster execution time, efficient
memory usage, real time support, and OS that is runtime upgradable,
configurable, and adaptable which is power efficient, secure, and
fault-tolerant.

## Mobile Clients

Securing mobile client device can be easily down by the use of passwords or
biometrics. However, there is still exists several security issues posses
threats to mobile client's security, like helper applications and plugins,
#javascript and VB script for HTML, [Extensible Sytlesheet Language (XSL)](202311211640.md),
Java applets, ActiveX control applets, [XML](202305281742.md)/SOAP clients for
.NET environment, and browser cookies.
