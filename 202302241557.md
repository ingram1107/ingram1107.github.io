# Muawiyah bin Abu Sufyan

Muawiyah bin Abu Sufyan was a member of Umayyad clans from Quraysh tribe of
Mecca and a cousin of [Caliph Uthman](202302241122.md). He was appointed as the
governor of Syria during [The Reign of Caliph Umar bin Al-Khattab](202302190619.md)
and established his power base there for 20 years. Due to the disagreement of
the treatment of Uthman's murderers with [Caliph Ali](202302241134.md) and his
own political ambitions, he fought over the First Fitna (first Muslim civil war)
against Ali, and eventually won the war after the death of Ali. He forced Hassan
bin Ali to abdicate as [Caliph](202302181011.md) and instead crowned himself in
Jerusalem, thus establishing the [Umayyad Caliphate](202302241657.md), reigning
from 661 to 750 (or 1031 if includes the Umayyad-ruled CÃ³rdoba Caliphate). He
moved the Caliphate capital from Medina to Damascus. Though able to repress the
resentments against his rule during his live time, his nomination of Caliph
succession to his son Yazid sparked outraged across the Caliphate, at the end
resulted in the [Second Fitna](202302241618.md).
