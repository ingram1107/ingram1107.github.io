# Socialist Democracy

Democracy means the subordination of the minority to the majority, where in
socialists sense, the minority means the oppressing class and the majority means
the oppressed class. When the #[state](202204202040.md) has been conquered by the
armed working class in a violent revolution, it is necessary to enforce such
democracy in order to suppress the capitalists.

The only just democracy, that is the true democracy, is an institution that
everyone is able to participate, whether the post should be a delegate to
the parliament, a local government official or a judge. This means that all
official posts, should be elected under universal suffrage which includes
[women's participation](202203121058.md)#. All government post, including the
delegates to the representative institution, must be non-lucrative (having the
same wage with average workers), held accountable and be subject to recall at
any time. Extra cautions should be made to prevent these government posts become
the springboard to more lucrative posts outside the institution.

The delegates in the parliament must be working instead of just debating. Their
responsibilities include executing their own laws, proposing laws in the
parliament and testing the results of those passed laws.

The socialist state, or more accurately the Commune, must be one and invisible.
This means that the state must be centralised and deploys complete local
self-governing where democracy are implemented.

All treaties, for it to be about war or trade, should be publicised. There
should be no secrecy behind them. The terms should not be concealed away from
the people of the nations that signed them, and should be easily accessible to
all people around the globe.
