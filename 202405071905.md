# Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP)

PHP is a process of removing [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md)
label from a packet by [Label Switching Router (LSR)](202305032302.md) before
the packet is passed to an adjacent [Label Edge Router (LER)](202305032259.md).
This saves up one cycle of label lookup in LER, reducing the load.
