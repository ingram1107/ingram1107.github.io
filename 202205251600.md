# Git Push

`push` is a #[202205251209](202205251209.md) command that used to push local repository to the
remote, which is the opposite of [202205251612](202205251612.md).

One can pass in refspecs in the format of `{local_branch}:{remote_branch}` into
the command `push {remote}` with [202205251604](202205251604.md)# in order to push the
[local branch](202204261226.md)# to a specific remote branch that is not referred
by the local branch. If you do not name the local branch, the remote branch will
be deleted instead. You could do this with [202205251612](202205251612.md) and [202204262031](202204262031.md)
too.
