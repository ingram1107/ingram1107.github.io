# Affirming The Consequent

Affirming The Consequent or Converse Error is a kind of
#[Logical Fallacy](202206172053.md) where one draw a conclusion from the
premises as if it is conversed. As we can see in [Conditional Fallacy](202205062055.md)#,
the converse of the conditional statement is not [logically equivalence](202205061231.md)#
to itself. The form could be seen below:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \rightarrow q \\
&q \\
\therefore \ &p
\end{align}
$$

The rule also applies on [Universal Statement](202204281245.md):

$$
\begin{align}
&\forall x, \text{if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x).\\
&Q(a) \text{ for a particular } a.\\
\therefore \ &P(a)
\end{align}
$$
