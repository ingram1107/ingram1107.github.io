# Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

JDBC is a Java API for accessing
[Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md) which is more suitable for
object-oriented database. Programmer can access any
[ODBC](202401290855.md)-compliant database through JDBC-to-ODBC bridge.

JDBC API supports [two-tier](202304202049.md) and three-tier (with a middleware)
processing models for database access. Three-tier solution may be preferred as
it can be used to maintain control over access and updates that can be made to
corporate data, simplifies the application deployment, and provides better
maintainability.

JDBC architecture consists of two layers: **JDBC API** and **JDBC driver API**.
JDBC API provides application-to-JDBC Manager connection and JDBC driver API
supports JDBC Manager-to-driver connection. JDBC uses a driver manager and
database-specific drivers to provide transparent connectivity to heterogeneous
databases. Driver manager ensures that the correct driver is used to access each
data source while at the same time maintain concurrent access to multiple
heterogeneous databases.

There are four types of JDBC drivers: JDBC-ODBC bridge driver, native-API driver
(partially Java driver), network protocol driver, and thin driver. JDBC-ODBC
bridge driver requires the client to install ODBC in order to use the driver,
and it is recommended to deploy this driver in development environment and for
testing purpose only. Native-API driver also requires the user to install the
natvie API on the client system. Network protocol driver and thin driver are
recommended to be deploy on production environment as they are extremely
flexible and no upfront software requirement in the client side. Thin driver is
best for user that only need to access one type of database. Network protocol
driver is preferred if there is a need of accessing multiple types of databases
at the same time as the database requests are pass through the network to the
middleware in which the translation done there.

Important components in JDBC are `DriverManager`, `Driver`, `Connection`,
`Statement`, and `ResultSet`. The following shows the example of the usage of
JDBC:

```java
import java.sql.*;
...
// load driver
Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC");
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:sqlite:sample.db");
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp");

while (rs.next()) {
    System.out.println(rs.getInt("id") + " " + rs.getString("name"));
}

con.close();
```
