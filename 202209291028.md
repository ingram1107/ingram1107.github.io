# Source Coding Theorem

Source Coding Theorem is a minimum limit on the compression (reducing
redundancy) done on the object that will not cause the loss of
[Information](202209291015.md)#. ~~It will~~ The goal is to produce ~~a lossless
compact format~~ an efficient representation of the original information.

The source code could be optimised using *variable-length code*, where rare
symbol code is encoded in long code and frequent symbol code is encoded in short
code such as in [Huffman Coding](202210140846.md)#. We can calculate the
[Average Code-Word Length](202210152219.md)# to get the coding efficiency of the
source coding scheme.

There are several source coding techniques:
- [Prefix Coding](202210102241.md)#
- [Huffman Coding](202210140846.md)#
- [Lempel-Ziv Coding](202210151030.md)#
