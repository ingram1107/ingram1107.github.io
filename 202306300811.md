# Stream Pipe

Stream Pipe in System V could be seen as an equivalent to the BSD Unix's
[Unix Domain Socket](202303232001.md) as both are full-duplex pipe while
comparing to the usual [Pipe](202210280908.md) with a difference where the Unix
domain socket doesn't have a shell associated with the standard output. In
System V, stream pipe is implement using a loop-around driver, meaning there are
two [streams](202306261611.md) connect through the driver as such the output of
one stream is the input of another and vice versa.
