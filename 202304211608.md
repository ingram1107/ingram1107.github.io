deployment of new product and repository reconfiguration) and any nonfunctional
aspect of an [Architecture](202304201731.md). There are several specialisations
of SAAM based the expansion or change of its focus:
- [Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM)](202304211610.md)
- [SAAM founded on Complex Scenarios (SAAMCS)](202304211618.md)
- [Extending SAAM by Integration in the domain (ESAAMI)](202304211619.md)
