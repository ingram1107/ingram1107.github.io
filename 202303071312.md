# Flyweight Pattern

Flyweight Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that allow intrinsic
state (state doesn't change in runtime) of an object to be stored as a single
object and be shared around other objects. It has the space advantage, that is
saving up the memory usage of the objects especially when there is a need of
thousand of those. Generally, there are three participants in this design
pattern: *flyweight factory* (creates and manages flyweight objects),
*flyweight* (share or unshared, stores intrinsic state), and *client* (maintains
reference to flyweight(s), computes or stores extrinsic state).

The Gang of Four advised to use Flyweight design pattern when:
1. An application uses a large amount of objects.
2. High storage costs.
3. Most object state can be made extrinsic (might change in runtime).
4. Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once
   extrinsic state is removed.
5. The application doesn't depend on object identity.

Flyweight may introduce runtime #performance penalties such as transferring,
finding, and computing extrinsic state of the object.

It can be combined with [Composite Pattern](202302101843.md) to represent a
hierarchical structure as a graph with shared leaf nodes. However, such shared
object can't store a pointer to its parent, in which we come out with an
alternative that the parent pointer is passed to the flyweight as part of its
extrinsic state.
