# Multiplexor

Multiplexor could be built by a process with the system call `ioctl()` alongside
with the flag `I_LINK` (the second parameter). In the system call, the first
[opened file descriptor](202210172248.md) that indicate a device driver to be
the predecessor for the subsequent drivers should be passed as the first
argument to the system call. The second driver acts as a lower layer driver
should be passed as the third argument to `ioctl()`. Note that only one `I_LINK`
operation can be done on each lower stream. The function `ioctl()` will return
the multiplexor identifier which could be used in dismantling (flag `UNLINK`) or
routing through it.

**Note**: In usual case, the multiplexor will be destroyed automatically upon
the end of life of the daemon process. This is, however, not without a
condition, i.e., where each multiplexor must be linked under next higher-level
multiplexor.
