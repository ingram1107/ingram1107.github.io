# Shared Memory

Instead of creating each buffer for read and write for both client and server in
[Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md), we can instead create a
share buffer where both client and server have access to. This is done through
Shared Memory segment, with the help from [semaphores](202212071928.md) (usually
two of them, one for client, one for server) to work against possible
[Race Condition](202112061109.md). The following shows the structure maintained
by the kernel to record the information about the Shared Memory segment:

```c
struct shmid_ds {
  struct ipc_perm shm_perm;     // permission
  int             shm_segsz;    // segment size
  struct XXX      shm_YYY;      // implementation dependent info
  unsigned short  shm_lpid;     // pid of last operation
  unsigned short  shm_cpid;     // creator pid
  unsigned short  shm_nattch;   // current number of attached
  unsigned short  shm_cnattach; // in-core number of attached
  time_t          shm_atime;    // last attach time
  time_t          shm_dtime;    // last dettach time
  time_t          shm_ctime;    // last change time
};
```

Import the library `sys/shm.h`, we can create a Shared Memory segment with the
[System Call](202210062303.md) `shmget()` by passing the [IPC Facilities Key](202212071232.md),
the requested size of the Shared Memory, and the flag used (such as `IPC_CREAT`
and `IPC_EXCL`). However, with this system call, it doesn't actually provide
access to the segment for the calling process. `shmat()` should be called to
attach the Shared Memory into the calling process's memory space by passing the
Shared Memory's ID, specified memory address, and the flag used (predominately
`SHM_RDONLY` for read-only access). If the value of user's specified memory
address is 0, the kernel is responsible to allocate the memory address for the
caller. Otherwise, depending on whether the flag is set to `SHM_RND`, the shared
memory is attached at the specified address which is rounded down by the
constant `SMLBA`. If that is not the case, the specified address is the memory
address for the Shared Memory. The system call `shmat()` returns the starting
memory address of the Shared Memory segment.

To detach a Shared Memory segment, we can utilise the system call `shmdt()` by
passing in the starting address of the Shared Memory obtained from `shmat()`.
That doesn't remove the Shared Memory though. Call `shmctl()`, alongside the
parameters of the Shared Memory ID, command specified (`IPC_RMID` to remove the
Shared Memory), and `shmid_ds`. The following codes show how to use Shared
Memory:

```c
#include <sys/shm.h>

key_t key = ftok(...);  // initialise key

int shmid;
shmid = shmget(key, 1000, IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL);  // or
shmid = shmget(IPC_PRIVATE, 1000, IPC_CREAT);     // to create a unique shared memory segment with the size of 1000
shmid = shmget(key, 1000, 0);                     // just to open the shared memory

char* shmbuf;
shmbuf = shmat(shmid, (char *)0, 0);           // attach a shared memory
shmbuf = shmat(shmid, (char *)0, SHM_RDONLY);  // attach a read-only shared memory

// write something to the shmbuf

shmdt(shmbuf); // deattach shared memory
shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, (struct shmid_ds *)0) // remove shared memory
```

Though implementing Shared Memory for client and server might sounds like a
performance improvement for I/O, a single Shared Memory doesn't improve the I/O
speed dramatically as the I/O still processed synchronously (due to the
protection of semaphores). Instead, we need to do I/O asynchronously, that is
using two Shared Memory buffers for separate read and write buffer for both
client and server. The idea is that when the server finishing its read on the
first buffer, it immediately read the second buffer while the client starts to
write to the first buffer. You can see that such procedures speed up the I/O
processing as two processes don't need to wait for access from the other.
