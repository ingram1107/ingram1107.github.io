# Variance of Code-Word Length

The Variance of Code-Word Length is defined as follows:

$$
\sigma = \sum^{K-1}_{K=0} p_k (l_k - \bar{L})^2
$$

Where:
- $\sigma$ is the Variance of Code-Word Length
- $K$ is the total number of symbol alphabets of source $S$
- $p$ is the probability of the symbol alphabet
- $l$ is the code length of the symbol alphabet
- $\bar{L}$ is the average number of bits per source symbol used in source
  encoding
