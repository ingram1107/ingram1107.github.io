# Participation in Liberal Democracy

Socialists are encouraged to participate in a liberal democracy under
[capitalist state](202204202040.md)#. This is to guide and educate the proletariat
in preparation of taking over the state power. However, it is not saying that
winning the majority in the parliament would result in transforming the
capitalist state into a socialist state. The purpose of organising the working
class is not to attenuate the contradiction of capitalism that will bring to its
[inevitable collapse](202205021551.md)#, but to realise that such social reform
will not bring the fundamental change to the current way of living.

The parliamentary practice is not about bringing immediate benefits to the
working class, but to use the platform to increase the class awareness and
consciousness of the proletariat, work alongside with [202205012054](202205012054.md), and
organise them as a class. If we only have short term goals, then what will come
is the practice of compensation, weaponising working class interests as our own
political bargaining chip.

As the proletariat realise that liberal parliamentarism and trade union will not
bring the expected social change that could end the suffering of their own, the
revolution will become the obvious choice for them.
