# Differentiated Service (DiffServ)

DiffServ is a networking architecture developed by [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md)
to define a coarse-grain [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) mechanism
by specifying its mechanism on classification and management of the QoS traffic.

To do that, it uses at least 4 bits to show the 4 types of type of service
(TOS), shown at below that the traffic is.
- D: Minimise delay (1000)
- T: Maximise throughput (0100)
- R: Maximise reliability (0010)
- C: Minimise cost (0001)

**Note**: If the bit is not set, that is the value of binary is 0000, then this
means that the traffic should be treated with a *standard manner*. This is
usually the default.

The following table shows the default type of service each protocol is:

| Protocol                                                 | TOS |
