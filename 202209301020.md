# Differentiated Service

Differentiated Service could be used to categorise the type of the network
traffic especially when needing to provide [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md)#.
To do that, it uses at least 4 bits to show the 4 types of type of service
(TOS), shown at below that the traffic is.
- D: Minimise delay (1000)
- T: Maximise throughput (0100)
- R: Maximise reliability (0010)
- C: Minimise cost (0001)

**Note**: If the bit is not set, that is the value of binary is 0000, then this
means that the traffic should be treated with a *standard manner*. This is
usually the default.

The following table shows the default type of service each protocol is:

| Protocol                                                 | TOS |
