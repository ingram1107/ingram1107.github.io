# Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

CIDR is an effective method of [IP Address](202206281021.md)# allocation
especially for [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) developed by
[Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md) which utilises the
prefix or the subnet mask. There is no [default subnet mask](202210152323.md)
for a network, instead it relies on [Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)](202210162049.md)#.
That being said, for CIDR to be deployed, the network must be contiguous, that
is having the same network mask (the prefix must be larger than the default
mask).

By using CIDR, we could reduce the size of the [Routing Table](202210112056.md)
as the supernet (network that is at a [higher hierarchy](202207071052.md)) is
able to summarise multiple network addresses with a subnet mask that is less
than the classful subnet mask. [Classless Routing Protocols](202210152246.md)#
will be used for routing update.
