# Constructive Proofs of Existence

Constructive Proofs of Existence is one of the [Mathematical Proof Methods](202302281137.md)
that prove an [Existential Statement](202204281254.md). For example, let's say
the statement is as follows:

$$
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } Q(x)
$$

The statement is true if, and only if, $Q(x)$ is true for **at least one** $x$
in $D$. Thus, we can either find a $x$ in $D$ that makes $Q(x)$ true or give a
set of directions for finding such $x$.
