# Product Usability

Product usability is measurable unlike [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md).
It might be compromised due to several aspects such as security and
functionalities. Likewise, those aspects are likely impact the usability of the
final product. These concerns should be taken into account during [Interaction Design (ID)](202303242118.md).

A highly usable product should be effective (good at doing), efficient (support
user) and safe to use, have good utility, easy to learn, and easy to remember
how to use.
