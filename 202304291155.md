# Facade Pattern

Facade pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that provides unified or
high-level interface to a set of interfaces in different subsystems to the
client. We can say that it glues the subsystems' interface together in a simpler
interface. It minimises the communication and dependencies between the
subsystems. Note that this pattern doesn't prevent the direct use of subsystem,
it just creates a simple and organised interface.

The Gang of Four advised to use facade pattern when:
1. We need to have a simple interface for complex or highly modularised
   subsystems.
2. Subsystem's implementation should be decoupled from the clients and other
   subsystems due to complex dependencies to promote subsystem independence and
   portability.
3. There is a need to layer the subsystems to simplify the dependencies.

There are two classes participate in this pattern, that is **facade** and
**subsystem class**. Facade class maps the request to the subsystem class and
forward it to the appropriate subsystem class. Subsystem class implements the
functionality and handle the request assigned by facade without knowing the
existence of the facade class. To conclude, the client will send a request
through a facade, in which it may translate it to fit subsystem class's context,
and then the facade delegates the request to the corresponding subsystem object.
Facade usually appears as a [Singleton](202211231900.md) as in most cases the
codebase only need one of it.

To further decouple the facade, we could either define facade as an abstract
class and make subsystem implementations as its subclasses or utilising
[Object Composition](202302051222.md). As the step of interacting with the
subsystem may be hard coded by the facade, we could increase its flexibility by
parametrised other subsystem classes to the facade, but this defeat the purpose
of providing a simple interface for the client to use. In such case,
[Abstract Factory Pattern](202303271021.md) is a wiser choice.
