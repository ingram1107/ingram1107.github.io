# Minimum Spanning Tree

We can find the minimum #[202207081445](202207081445.md) in [202204112129](202204112129.md)# and
[202204112118](202204112118.md)#. However, the solution for digraph appears to be more
difficult.

For undirected graph, if it is connected, then there will be a tree that
connects all the vertices in the graph, that is the *minimum spanning tree*. The
number of edges of the minimum spanning tree will be $\vert V \vert - 1$ as $V$
is the total number of edges of the undirected graph.

In an undirected graph, it could be solved by two algorithms:
- [202204272017](202204272017.md)#
- [202204272019](202204272019.md)#.
