# Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)

CDP is a #[Data Link Layer](202206131651.md) Cisco proprietary tool used to
gather information about other directly connected [Cisco network devices](202210012232.md).
However, it is recommended to disable CDP by `no cdp run` for the entire device
or `no cdp enable` for one particular interface.

Its vendor-neutral alternative is Link-Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP).
