# Kubernetes Pod

Pod is the smallest #[202201291535](202201291535.md) unit which provides the abstraction over
the containers inside it. If a pod dies, Kubernetes will restart it with a
new state.

You should not be able to interact with Pod directly. Instead, interact with
[202201311650](202201311650.md)#.

## Configuration

See [202202152103](202202152103.md)#.
