# Ansible Inventory

Inventory is a list of nodes, where #[202204272036](202204272036.md) run against, managed by
#[202204272021](202204272021.md). Ansible has a default inventory file `/etc/ansible/hosts` but
it could be changed using the option `-i`. We could create multiple groups that
can contain multiple hosts either in domain name or [202206151453](202206151453.md)# within an
inventory.

**Note**: Although Inventory could be used to store [202205042134](202205042134.md)#, it is
advised to only define them if they are necessary for device connection such as
user password and mean of communication.

A typical Inventory is file-based which could be in INI or YAML format. Some are
in a service or in git repository. This is shown as follows:

```ini
[webservers]  # webservers group
b2bwebprod1 urlpath=https://b2bprod.abc.xyz
b2bwebprod2 ansible_host=10.100.25.3  # set name for IP address 10.100.25.3
b2bwebprod3 ansible_host=10.100.25.4  # set name for IP address 10.100.25.4

[appservers]  # appservers group, contains both IP addresses and domain name
10.25.13.25
10.40.12.44
b2bappprod1
b2bappprod2
b2bappprod3

[frontend:children] # parent group for group webservers and appservers
webservers
appservers
b2bslavedb

[webservers:vars]   # define group variables for webservers group
server_path=/var/www/html

[all:vars]          # define variables for all groups
user_name=ansible
ssh_key=/home/clover/.ssh/ssh.rsa
```

**Note**: By default, #[202204272021](202204272021.md) use
[Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md)# for name lookup. This could be
circumvented by using the option `ansible_host` where custom name is assigned to
an IP address.

**Note**: Using keyword `children` after the group name impose a hierarchy of
groups. Such group can contain both groups and hosts.

**Note**: Using keyword `vars` after the group name define
[group variables](202205042134.md) which are only able to be used for that group.
However, if the name before the keyword is `all`, the variables could be used by
every group or host in the Inventory.
