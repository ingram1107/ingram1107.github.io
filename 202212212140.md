# SNMPv1 1988

#[SNMPv1](202212211531.md) is defined by RFC 1065 - 1067 which specify as a
protocol supporting stand-alone [Management Station or Manager](202212211516.md)
and [Management Agent](202212211524.md). Limited but easily implemented
[Management Information Base (MIB)](202212211528.md) of scalar variables and two
dimensional tables are defined. It is designed to be a streamlined (simple but
efficient) protocol with limited functionality such as allows only centralised
network management. The connection between the manager and agent is done using
[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)#.

SNMPv1 uses community, a relationship between an SNMP agent and SNMP managers,
to establish trust between them. It provides three aspects of agent control
including: [authentication service](202210040915.md)#, [access policy](202210022203.md)#,
and proxy service. This is later inherited by its successor [SNMPv2 1993](202212212148.md)#.
However, it has a major security issue as it transmits a password, called
"community string", in cleartext to authenticate clients.

Get commands are atomic in SNMPv1.
