# Intent-Based Networking (IBN)

IBN is a [Software Defined Network (SDN)](202305152046.md)-based oenology that
provides #software with rules, guidelines, or intent so that data could modify
the network, infrastructure features, or security features within a network. In
this way, it can seamlessly and securely integrate organisational network with
[Internet of Things (IoT)](202408142322.md) devices,
[cloud-based](202210012158.md) services, and remote offices. IBN consists three
elements, that is, **assurance** (end-to-end verification of network-wide
behaviour), **translation**, and **activation**.

IBN harnesses the power of [Automation](202409100037.md),
[AI](202409100038.md), and [ML](202409100041.md) to control the function of a
network to accomplish a specific intent, such that network is able to translate
it into policies and utilise automation to deploy appropriate configurations.

Example of IBN:
- Cisco Digital Network Architecture (Cisco DNA)
