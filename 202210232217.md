# Primitive Root

Considering $a^m \mod n = 1$, $GDC(a, n) = 1$, then there must exist for $m =
\phi(n)$ (from [Euler's Theorem](202210222028.md)#) but may be smaller and once
powers reach $m$, cycle will repeat. If the smallest is $m = \phi(n)$ then $a$
is called a Primitive Root.

If $p$ is prime, then successive powers of $a$ "generate" the group $\mod p$.
However, it is relatively hard to find Primitive Root.

**Note**: I've no idea what the hell I'm talking about.
