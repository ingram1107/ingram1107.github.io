# Molecular Biology

Molecular biology is a study of molecular processes of [DNA replication](202308091148.md),
[Transcription](202308091156.md), [Translation](202308091201.md), and cell
functions. It emphasises on the molecules' sequence, structure, and function and
processes including mechanism, specificity, and regulation. Applications of
molecular biology are molecular cloning, polymerase chain reaction(PRC), and
[Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)](202308171958.md).
