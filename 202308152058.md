# Molecular Biology

Molecular biology is a study of molecular processes of [DNA replication](202308091148.md),
[Transcription](202308091156.md), [Translation](202308091201.md), and cell
functions. It emphasises on the molecules' sequence, structure, and function and
processes including mechanism, specificity, and regulation. Applications of
molecular biology are molecular cloning, polymerase chain reactino (PRC), and
next generation DNA sequencing (NGS).
