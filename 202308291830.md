# Functional Dependency

Functional dependency is a characteristic of an [Attribute](202304200943.md) in
which when it is not the primary key for the corresponding
[Relation](202204282024.md), it may affect other attributes and make them
[redundant](202302171903.md).

We can formalise functional dependency as follows:

$$
\alpha \rightarrow \beta \text{ if } \forall (t_1 \land t_2) \text{ where }
t_1[\alpha] = t_2[\alpha], t_1[\beta] = t_2[\beta]
$$

Where:
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ represents set of attributes
- $t$ represents relation

We can say that the functional dependency between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is
*trivial* if $\beta \subseteq \alpha$
