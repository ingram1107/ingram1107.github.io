# Prime Factorisation

To factor a number $n$ is to write it as a product of prime numbers as defined
below:

$$
n = \prod_{p \in P} p^{a_p}
$$

Where:
- $P$ is a [Set](202204281446.md) of prime numbers
- $p$ is a prime number

It is one of the method to determine the [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](202210092214.md)
by finding the product of common prime factors.
