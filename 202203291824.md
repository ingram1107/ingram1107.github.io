# Forwarding References

Due to the shortcomings of lvalue and rvalue references in C++, forwarding
references (or some would call it universal references) becomes the alternative
for resources' referencing or copying.

It is rather easy to confuse the syntax of rvalue references and forwarding
references. Just remember that forwarding references is always come with
template, and it is immediately attached to the type itself. See the following
examples:

```cpp
void f(Widget&& w);     // rvalue reference

template<typename T>
void f(Widget<T>&& w);  // still a rvalue reference

template<typename T>
void f(T&& w);          // forwarding reference
```

Forwarding references could be used alongside with variadic template in order to
accept multiple arguments with no hassle of value type conversion. This is
showed as the following:

```cpp
template<typename... T>
void f(T&&... w) {
  do_something(std::forward<T>(w)...);
}
```

Although forwarding references is a good alternative for generality, it does not
actually preserve the value type of the arguments after they enter the local
scope. In order to do this, we need [202203291851](202203291851.md)#.

## Caution

Because of the generality of forwarding reference, there is always a possibility
that some functions does not do what you think. Remember this rule: C++ compiler
will always find the **perfect match** for a generated function with the given
parameters, otherwise a function with forwarding reference will almost always be
chosen as the alternative.

**Do not forward something twice**! Once we have forwarded an object, it is not
yours to use anymore.
