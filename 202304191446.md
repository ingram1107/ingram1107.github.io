# Conceptual Schema

Conceptual schema provides a detail overview of an organisation. In terms of
[Entity-Relationship Model (E-R)](202302101334.md), it specifies the entities in
the [Database](202302101139.md), the attributes of those entities, their
relationships between each other, and their corresponding constraint. A good
designer will constantly review the conceptual schema made to meet the stated
[Functional Requirement](202303251342.md).
