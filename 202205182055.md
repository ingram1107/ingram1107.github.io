# Wahhabism

Wahhabism (short as wahabi) is a Sunni revivalist and fundamentalist movement
which is heavily influenced by the Islamic scholar Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab
and another Sunni reform movement #[202205182028](202205182028.md). It was originated in Najd
and play a major role on the nation building of Saudi Arabia where al-Wahhab was
deeply entrenched in Saudi politics especially with the Saud royal family.

It advocates that (1) ritual action is more important than the intentions, (2)
to not respect the dead, and (3) Muslim doesn't need to have intermediate prayers
even if they were saint or prophets.

Some claimed that wahabi are quite progressive in Malaysia but it is without
efficient proofs.
