# constexpr

`constexpr` give the C++ compilers a hint that the function or the variable need
to be valid during the compile time. It is by design thread-safe.

## Using on Variable

It is essentially the same with declaring a `const` variable that is the
variable should not be change in either compile time or runtime. This make the
variable avoid all #[downside of concurrency](202202011815.md).

## Using on Function

`constexpr` force the function to resolve each dependency at compile time. Any
attempts on extending (`static` and `thread_local`) the variable's lifetime or
using such variables in the scope of the function is rejected. In addition,
`constexpr` function cannot have side effect.

This eventually makes the function #[pure](202202081524.md).

Since `constexpr` function is evaluated in compile time, it makes the function
more efficient compare to its non-`constexpr` counterpart.
