# System Container

System #[202202211633](202202211633.md) simulate a full-fledge operating system,
included the [Kernel](202210062254.md)#, system libraries and the targeted
application to be contained, on top the containment facilities provided by the
underlying host kernel. It is quite similar to [202204071131](202204071131.md)
but used only the kernel facilities.
