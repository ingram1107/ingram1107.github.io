# Fleeting Note

Fleeting Note is used to record **newly** found information. It could be
handwritten, which is suggested by the academics, or in digital form.

This kind of notes should be treated as temporary notes that should be later
incorporated into the #[Zettelkasten](202110160303.md) in the form of
[Permanent Note](202203281521.md)#.
