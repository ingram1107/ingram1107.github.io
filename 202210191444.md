# Simple Authentication Dialogue

Simple Authentication Dialogue is a simple scheme that
[authenticates](202210040915.md)# users with username and password. It comes
with a problem: If the password is transmitted in plaintext, then the user is
vulnerable to [eavesdropping](202209261916.md)#. Furthermore, it could prompt
too many times for the user to enter their password as their sessions come to an
end which could be one of the information the [Cryptanalyst](202209281128.md)
can utilise.
