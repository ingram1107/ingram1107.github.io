# One-Way Function

One-Way Function is a function that is easy to compute (in polynomial time) on
every input but hard to invert given the random input (in non-polynomial time).

For example:

$$
\begin{align}
Y &= f(X)\\
X &= f^{-1}(Y)\\
\end{align}
$$

The first function is easy to compute, but the second is hard.
