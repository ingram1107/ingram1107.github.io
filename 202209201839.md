# Perl Array

We can access an element from a Perl Array using either positive integer
(starting from 0) and negative integer. For negative integer, it's counting will
start from the end of the array. For example, index -1 will access the last
element in the array whereas index -3 will access the third last element in the
array.

Array can be defined in two ways, either using `qw()` or a list:

```perl
my @array = qw ( a b c );
my @array = (a, b, c);
```

We could also create an Array #[Reference](202207211229.md) using square
brackets `[]`:

```perl
my $arrayRef = [ a, b, c ];
```

**Note**: It is possible to combine two Arrays into an Array, but that Perl will
not retain the container, that is the original owner of the data. This means
there is no way to know who owns the data in the bigger Array. One of the
solution to this is using #[Perl Reference](202207211229.md).

There are two ways to know the length or the total number of elements of a Perl
Array: `scalar()` and direct assignment. Using `scalar()` is a more expressive
way that you could find out the length of an array. Just pass in the array that
you need to know its length to the function and assigned its result to a
variable like the following, so you can get the desired answer:

```perl
my @array = qw ( Hello World );
my $len = scalar(@array); # Result: 2
```

Directly assigning a Perl Array to a scalar variable (that is string and
integer) could do the same thing as `scalar()` did, though less expressive. The
example is shown below:

```perl
my @array = qw ( Hello World );
my $len = @array; # Result: 2
```

**Note**: Either case, the length or the total number of elements of a Perl
Array does count [undef](202207192226.md)# as a valid member. Therefore, it
shouldn't surprise you if the above-mentioned methods count undef elements in
the total number of elements inside the array.

Sorting an array could be as simple as using the `sort()` function. Just pass in
the array as the parameter of the function, then the function will sort the
elements in *alphabetical order* and put them into a *new array*. This could be
useful in sorting strings, but it is not suited for number ordering. As such, we
could define the condition for the sorting algorithm `{}` for it to sort the
array in a way we wanted. Both use cases are shown below:

```perl
my @str_array = qw ( apple orange calsium );
my @sorted_str_array = sort(@str_array);  # Result: apple, calsium, orange

my @num_array = qw ( 10 8 19 1 29 );
my @sorted_num_array_with_default = sort(@num_array); # Result: 10, 19, 1, 29, 8
my @sorted_num_array_with_custom = sort { @a<=>@b } (@num_array);
# Result: 1, 8, 10, 19, 29
```

**Note**: `sort()` will not alter the elements' order in the original array.

To clear an array, assign array to an empty bracket like `my @array = ();`.
**Don't define** array as `undef`! It will fill up the array with `undef`
elements which still counted as valid elements. An empty array returns an
integer of 0, which is treated as false in terms of
[Perl Boolean](202207211219.md)#.
