# Unique Factorisation of Integers Theorem

Unique Factorisatino of Integers Theorem or Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
states that given any integer $n > 1$, there exist a positive integer $k$,
distinct prime numbers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$, and positive integers $e_1, e_2,
\ldots, e_k$ such that:

$$
n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} p_3^{e_3} \ldots p_k^{e_k}
$$

And any other expression for $n$ as a product of prime numbers is identical to
this except for the order in which the factors are written. One would write the
$n$ in *standard factored form*, that is the prime factors are written in
ascending order from left to right.
