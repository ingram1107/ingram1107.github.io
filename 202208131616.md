# Version Control System (VCS)

VCS or more strictly Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a system that track
the changes of information within a centralize entity, called repository. It
should not only contain files with various format, but also archive a history of
changes and their relationship to each other, sometimes even the version of
other program used such as #compiler and #operating-system.

It features various functionalities, but not always, for the developers to take
advantage of in order to ease the revision control:
- viewing the change history
- undoing changes
- [noting the author of the change](202205271153.md)#
- viewing differences between versions
- viewing the changes made by current version
- tagging releases (assigning version)
- branching

[@Hunt1999](lit/@Hunt1999.md) advices to use VCS in every places possible even
in small projects, [prototypes](202207120959.md)#,
