# Interrupt Table

Interrupt table consists of maximum frequency (process time constraint), vector
address where interrupt handler (ISR) must be installed, interrupt request (IRQ)
etc. It enables the programmer to design and implement better ISRs that allow
for nested interrupts. With interrupt table, pre-emption of lower priority
interrupt by higher one is possible.
