# Problem Space Understanding

The following steps guide us to form a good understanding on the problem space
when trying to understand [Product Usability](202303242139.md) and [User Experience (UX)](202303242126.md):
1. What do we want to create? (the project scope)
2. What are the [Assumptions](202304152134.md) made?
3. What are the [Claims](202304152136.md) made?
4. Will it achieve what we hope it will? If so, how?

One approach to it could be to consider user's [Cognitive](202304291456.md)
ability. In designing a product, we should consider the user cognitive load
(what they can and can't be expected to do), identify, and explain the problems
users encountered via theories, modelling tools, guidances, and methods.

Having a good understanding in problem space help inform the [design space](202304152141.md).
