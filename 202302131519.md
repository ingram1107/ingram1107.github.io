# n-Tier Model

n-Tier Model is a [Data Center](202210012205.md) design model that separate
several servers into manageable and secure tiers, so that risk could be
distributed across several servers and also increase the scalability of the
services and eases server management. Based on its primary functionality, the
server in a data centre could be graded as:
- **First-Tier**/**Front-Tier** that hosts client-facing services
- **Middle-Tier** that maps croprate data to how a company operates
- **Final-Tier**/**Backend** that hosts databases, storage, and raw data to be
  shared
