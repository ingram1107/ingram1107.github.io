# Linear Probing

Linear Probing is a strategy for #[202112131222](202112131222.md) that trying cell sequentially
in searching of empty cell.

## Details

- [202112122038](202112122038.md) is usually $F(i) = i$

## Analysis

- Insertions are cheaper earlier, but they are more expensive after every insert
- Unsuccessful search will result in $\frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{(1 -
  \lambda)^2})$ number of probes
- Successful search will result in $\frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{(1 - \lambda)})$
  number of probes

## Attention

- [202112131249](202112131249.md)# could be a pain
