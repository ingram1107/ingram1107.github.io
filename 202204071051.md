# Control Groups (Cgroups)

**Note**: The cgroups that we are talking in this section mainly concerns about
version 1. If it is about version 2, it will be explicit.

Cgroups is a #[202204081225](202204081225.md) kernel feature that set resource utilisation limits on
processes on the system. Default cgroups and their data could be found in
`/sys/fs/cgroup/`.

There are several features introduced by Cgroups, namely:
- resource restriction
- prioritisation
- accounting/logging
- process control (using *freezer* to take a snapshot and move process)

Cgroups are created per resource type without associations with each other. This
means that Linux kernel could manage different types of applications with
different standard of resource management. It is sort of similar to
[202203281429](202203281429.md) where the view of PID in Cgroups is different from the system
and from each other.

One could impose restriction on the resources could be used in one cgroup. For
example, we could define the value for CPUShares in `cpu.shares` file to
initialise the weight or priority cgroups on CPU time-share. To avoid the users
sharing the precious CPU time with system resources, make sure that `cpu.weight`
in `system.slice` is larger than `user.slice`.

## Creation

A typical cgroups structure looks like below:

```
/my_cgroups
  <resource controller type>
    <group 1>
    <group 2>
    <group 3>
```

Custom cgroups should follow the structure above before mounted using the
command `mount -t cgroup -o {resource} none
{path-to-cgroups-resource-controller}`. After the successful mounting, the
directory for the resource controller will be populated with files in regard to
its corresponding resources specified by the mount option `-o`.
