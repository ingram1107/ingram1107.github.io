# Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

WDM is one of the implementation of #[Multiplexing](202209091259.md), classified
as #[Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md), which utilises the
feature of the light as a wave. Since light waves of different wavelengths do
not interfere with one another within a medium, it is possible to multiplex
different channel travelling in different wavelengths in a single
[Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md) simultaneously.

There are several technologies utilise WDM as a mean for multiplexing especailly
those that are travelling with optical light pulses:
- [Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)](202209021746.md)#
- [Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)](202209021754.md)#
