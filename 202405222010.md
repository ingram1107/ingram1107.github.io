# Asynchronous Exception

In contrast to [Synchronous Exception](202405222002.md), asynchronous
[Exception](202405222000.md) is raised by external events, usually related to
hardware signals. Thus, according to this definition, making interrupt is the
well-known type of asynchronous exception.

Asynchronous exception could be maskable, that is can be blocked or enabled by
software, or non-maskable like hardware-reset, non-maskable interrupt (NMI) etc.
