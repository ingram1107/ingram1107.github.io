# Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol

SR protocol is a kind of [Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol](202303141902.md)
based on [Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol](202303141912.md) (with window size) that
allows out-of-order arrival. The window size must be less than or equal to the
half of the size of sequence number space for SR protocol. The out-of-order
arrival is allowed as each packet keeps their own individual logical
[Timer](202404061106.md) (which can be calculated by a single #hardware timer).
Those out-of-order packets will be buffered until the lowest sequence number
packet are received from the sender, by then they will be sent together to the
upper layer. The window on the receiver side will then be moved according to the
number of packets delivered to the upper layer. On the sender side, the window
will move to the next unacknowledged packet with the smallest sequence number if
the packet which its sequence number is equal to the window base (first)
sequence number has received its ACK. If there are packets arrived that has
sequence number lower than the current first sequence number of the window on
the receiver side, that are already sent to the upper layer, those packets must
be re-acknowledged, so that the sender side window will not stick forever and
keep sending those already delivered packets.
