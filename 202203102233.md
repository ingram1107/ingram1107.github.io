# K-way Merge

Like #[202203102127](202203102127.md), it splits the file contents into parts with size of $M$
which will be sorted using one of the [202203102004](202203102004.md).

Unlike [202203102127](202203102127.md), it could use more than two, $k$, drives or tapes as
input or output. $k$ parts will then be grouped into a run which will be stored
into $k$ drives or tapes. It is ill-advised to use comparison to obtain the
smallest element among the parts since it could result in $O(N^2)$ which is bad.
We could take advantage of some #data-structure peculiarly [202202062259](202202062259.md) or
[202112102110](202112102110.md). We will then obtain a sorted run by repeating the process
[recursively](202202151731.md). The same steps will be performed for the next run.

## Analysis

- It will require $\lceil \log_k(\frac{N}{M} \rceil$ passes.
- It is more efficient than [202203102127](202203102127.md) since the increase of tapes and
  drives reduce the required passes to process all the runs.
- This could be further optimised by [202203111148](202203111148.md)#
