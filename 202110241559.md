# Vim Tabpage Interesting Commands
- `tabo` - close all other tab pages
- `tabr`/`tabfir` - jump to the first tab page
- `tabl` - jump to the last tab page
- `tabs` - list all available tab pages
- `tabm` - Move the current tab page to after tab page N. Use zero to make the
  current tab page the first one.  N is counted before the move, thus if the
  second tab is the current one, `:tabmove 1` and `:tabmove 2` have no effect.
  Without N the tab page is made the last one. >
  - :.tabmove   " do nothing
  - :-tabmove   " move the tab page to the left
  - :+tabmove   " move the tab page to the right
  - :0tabmove   " move the tab page to the beginning of the tab
  - " list

  - :tabmove	" move the tab page to the last
  - :$tabmove	" as above
  - :tabmove $	" as above
- `tabm +/-` - same as `tabm`, + represent right, - represent left
