# Hardware Scheduling

A [clock](202403301942.md) issues [interrupt signals](202404141448.md) directed
to an interrupt controller. The latter then issues interrupt signals depending
on the order of arrival and the priority of the interrupt involved. If the
[Computer Architecture](202403151651.md) supports multiple interrupts, then the
hardware handles dispatching as well. Otherwise, the interrupt-handling routine
has to read the interrupt vector on the interrupt controller in order to
determine which interrupt occurred and dispatch the appropriate tasks.

**Note**: Hardware scheduling may be implemented in microcode for some
processors.
