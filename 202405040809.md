# Priority Inheritance Protocol (PIP)

PIP is a greedy [Resource Access Control Protocol](202405040805.md) that makes
the lower priority task to immediately inherit the priority value from higher
priority task blocked by it due to resource contention. After executing its
critical section and releasing the resource, the task returns to its original
priority value. There are two types of blocking in PIP, which are direct
blocking and priority inheritance blocking.

PIP eliminates [Unbounded Priority Inversion](202405040759.md) as tasks with a
priority in between cannot pre-empt the lower priority task. However, it doesn't
have the mechanism to prevent [Deadlocks](202202191853.md) from happening, and
[Bounded Priority Inversion](202405040756.md) could be exaggerated since a task
can be blocked by as many lower priority tasks as there are. This is further
worsened by the fact that priority inheritance blocking allows the blocking even
without resource contention.

PIP is supported by most commercial RTOS.
