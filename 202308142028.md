# Open Reading Frame (ORF)

ORF is a span of [DNA](202308082154.md) sequence between the start and stop
[Codons](202308091320.md). In other words, ORF is the region of DNA that has the
ability to be [translated](202308091201.md). A start codon of mRNA is usually
AUG which is ATG or methionine in DNA counterpart. Stop codon of mRNA could be
either UAA, UAG, or UGA, which, conversely, are TAA, TAG, and TGA in DNA.
