# Mailbox

Mailbox is a special memory location used for [Tasks or Threads Synchronisation](202404301021.md).
It usually provides system calls such as `post()` (write) and `pend()` (read)
for data access management instead of providing direct access like
[Shared Memory](202302251019.md). Pending task is suspended, and no polling is
done on the mailbox, thus saving CPU cycle. Other operations could be
implemented such as accept operation (allow reading the mail if it is
available), time-out `pend()` (prevent [Deadlocks](202202191853.md)), queuing
etc.

It is typically implemented as a supervisor task of highest priority in the
fashion of [Task Control Block (TCB)](202404150720.md). Like in TCB, two status
tables are kept: one contains a list of tasks and their needed resources,
another contains the resources and their current states.

Upon the invocation of system call and hardware interrupt, the mailbox will
check on the mailbox. If the corresponding mail is available, that is the
mailbox is "full", the task's state is changed to ready. If it is a post
request, then the mail is placed into the mailbox and its status updated to
"full".
