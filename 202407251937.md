# Client-Server Model

Client-server model defines two roles, that is, client and server. Client is
responsible for initiating requests whereas server is responsible for processing
those requests and returning responses accordingly. (See [Client-Server Architecture](202304202049.md))

Message passing with queuing or [Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)](202302161128.md)
could be used as a communication model between client(s) and server.
Synchronisation between client and server can be done synchronously or
asynchronously, though the latter is preferred as client's requests are queued
locally in the server and the control is returned immediately to the client.
