# Mutex in Pthread

Mutex is a lock that could be used to prevent threads from reading from and/or
writing to the variable that they share between each other. This could prevent
the #[202112061109](202112061109.md) from happening since the program will be able to deny
granting access of that variable to other threads when the mutex is currently
locked by a thread. Such mechanism is great for code synchronisation.

In pthread, the creation of mutex could be done by declaring a global
`pthread_mutex_t` variable and initialise it by calling `pthread_mutex_init`. To
lock it, call `pthread_mutex_lock` onto the mutex, and to unlock, call
`pthread_mutex_unlock` onto the mutex. At the end, we need to destroy the mutex
from the program by calling `pthread_mutex_destroy`.

```c
pthread_mutex_t mutex;

// in the program
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);

// at somewhere
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

// at the end of the program
pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
```

## Trylock

Instead of using `pthread_mutex_lock`, one could use `pthread_mutex_trylock` to
avoid threads from waiting. When `pthread_mutex_trylock` is called, the thread
will first try to obtain the mutex lock for itself. If that fail, the function
will return non-zero value to indicate that the current mutex is busy, and the
thread will execute its remaining content, of course without the content locked
by the mutex. If it is a success, the function will return 0. Therefore,
checking the return value of `pthread_mutex_trylock` is necessary.

```c
if (pthread_mutex_trylock(&mutex) == 0) {
  // locked content
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
}

// remaining content
```

## Recursive Lock

When the thread need to lock the mutex for multiple times, it is wise to use the
recursive lock in order to prevent [202202191853](202202191853.md). Since the default
initialisation of mutex does not allow us to recursively lock it, we need to
modify its attribute. To do that, we need to declare a `pthread_mutexattr_t` and
then initialise it by calling `pthread_mutexattr_init`. Set the correct type by
calling `pthread_mutexattr_settype`. When calling on `pthread_mutex_init`, pass
it to its second parameter. Later on, clean it up using
`pthread_mutexattr_destroy`.

```c
pthread_mutexattr_t attr;

pthread_mutexattr_init(&attr);
pthread_mutexattr_settype(&attr, PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE);
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, &attr);
pthread_mutexattr_destroy(&attr);
```

## Static Initialiser

Mutex could be statically initialised without using `pthread_mutex_init` in
order to acquire the necessary resources for itself. This could be a good
shorthand for the user to keep this in their repertoire.

```c
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
```

Although `pthread_mutex_destroy` has become optional in this case, it is a good
practice to keep it as it is much clearer where does the resources have been
cleanup.
