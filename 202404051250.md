# Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)

ASIC is constructed for one specific-purpose application only and replaces
general-purpose logic circuitry. It integrates several functionalities into a
single chip which reduce the needed number of circuits. However, it is expensive
to be manufactured, and once it is done, no modification can be done on the
circuit other than changing the whole IC layout entirely.
