# Serving Gateway (S-GW)

S-GW is a component in [Evolved Packet Core (EPC)](202305131616.md) that is
responsible for routing information packet, maintaining information link
intended for inter-[eNodeB](202305131737.md) handovers (same as inter-system
handovers among [LTE](202304111948.md) and [UTMS](202304111944.md) or
[GSM](202304111937.md)), and storing user equipment (UE) framework (like bearer
service parameter with routing data). It is the major connection among the radio
access network with the core network.
