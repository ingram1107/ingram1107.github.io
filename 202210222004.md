# Euler Totient Function

Euler Totient Function $\phi(n)$ is defined as number of elements in reduced set
of residues. Reduced set of residues is the numbers in a [Set](202204281446.md)
of residues $Z_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ which are [relatively prime](202210092214.md)#
to $n$. There are several rules on computing Euler Totient Function:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(p) &= p - 1\\
\phi(n) &= \phi(p \cdot q) = (p - 1)(q - 1)\\
\phi(p^e) &= p^e - p^{e-1}\\
\phi(1) &= 1\\
\phi(n) &= \phi(a \cdot b) = \phi(a) \times \phi(b)
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers
