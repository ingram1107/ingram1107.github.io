# Multipath Propagation

Multipath propagation may cause multiple copies of a [signal](202302161842.md)
arrive at different times and [inter-symbol interference (ISI)](202305101951.md).
It may occur due to [reflection](202305101934.md),
[diffraction](202305101936.md), and [scattering](202305101942.md).
