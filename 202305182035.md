# HCI Design Pattern

[Human Computer Interaction (HCI)](202303242108.md) design pattern is an
approach of reusing knowledge, that is design patterns, about successful
[design solutions](202303242118.md). [Design Patterns](202211221249.md) are
predefined guides as to how to solve a recurrent problem within a specific
context. They don't exist in isolation but are linked to other patterns in
languages which enable complete designs to be generated.

Design patterns capture design practice and the essential common properties of
good design examples. They represent design knowledge at varying levels such as
social, organisational, conceptual, detailed etc., embody values, and can
express what is humane in interface design. They are intuitive and readable with
the help of a pattern language (generative and assist in design development),
thus can be used for communication between all stakeholders.
