# HomeRF

HomeRF is a [Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)](202303292149.md) technology
based on [IEEE 802.11](202303292155.md) intended to provide cheap and simple
home networking. However, it achieved the other way around due to its
incompatible with Wi-Fi equipments (need of separate access cards), different
[cordless band](202304212216.md) among different countries, and the abandonment
from US users to [Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)](202305181312.md)
IEEE 802.16. HomeRF has a maximum bandwidth of 1 Mbps, with an upgrade
(HomeRF2), it may achieve maximum bandwidth of 10 Mbps. While comparing to
legacy IEEE 802.11b, the underlying Shared Wireless Access Protocol (SWAP)
provides better #security mechanism, [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md),
and built-in support for [telephony](202303311239.md).
