# Real Time Clock

Real time clock is a [Timer](202404061106.md) that tracks time, date, month, and
year. Since it has its own battery-powered [Dynamic RAM (DRAM)](202403142052.md),
real time clock is capable to be independent of CPU and
[Programmable Interval Timer (PIT)](202405251410.md) and maintains real time
between system power cycles.
