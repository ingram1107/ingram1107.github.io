# Existential Universal Statement

If a [202204281244](202204281244.md) consists of both the property of [202204281254](202204281254.md)# and #[202204281245](202204281245.md), which is itself a kind of #[202205061208](202205061208.md), then it is an Existential Universal Statement

Let's see an example: There is a book in my room that is thicker than every
book in my room. It is an Existential Universal Statement since it has first the
*existential property* (there is), then the *universal property* (every). It could be transformed
without losing its meaning:
- There is a book $b$ in my room that is thicker than every book in my room.
- There is a book $b$ in my room such that every book in my room is thinner than
  $b$.
