# Existential Universal Statement

If a [Mathematical Statement](202204281244.md) consists of both the property of
[Existential Statement](202204281254.md)# and #[Universal Statement](202204281245.md),
which is itself a kind of #[Compound Statement](202205061208.md), then it is an
Existential Universal Statement

Let's see an example: There is a book in my room that is thicker than every book
in my room. It is an Existential Universal Statement since it has first the
*existential property* (there is), then the *universal property* (every). It
could be transformed without losing its meaning:
- There is a book $b$ in my room that is thicker than every book in my room.
- There is a book $b$ in my room such that every book in my room is thinner than
  $b$.
