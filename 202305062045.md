# Payback Period

Payback period is the amount of time required to recover the solution's
investment. In other words, it is the time when the net cumulative benefits
equal to the net cumulative costs (see [Net Present Value (NPV)](202305061940.md)).
A typical payback period is between 6 and 24 months for IT solutions. We can
calculate the payback period by:

$$
\text{Payback period} = \frac{\text{cumulative benefits and costs}^{\text{year }
n - 1 \text{ just before equilibrium}}}{\text{discounted benefits and
costs}^{\text{year } n \text{ just after equilibrium}}} \times \text{time unit} +
(n - 1) \times \text{time unit}
$$

**Note**: Do not attempt to outsmart the formula by converting by the time unit
when the question asks for the payback period in different time unit. This will
result in a drifting value that may not be accurate for an analysis.
