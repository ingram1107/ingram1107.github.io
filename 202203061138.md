# Clojure

Clojure is a #[functional](202203061121.md) Lisp programming language. Although
like other functional programming it emphasises on [202202081524](202202081524.md), Clojure
also allows impure functions. [202203061126](202203061126.md)# and keywords could act as
functions too.

**Note**: It is advised to use only impure functions when doing I/O.

Like other Lisp-variants, Clojure compose two main components: Reader and
Evaluator. Reader reads the source into reader data where such data will be
passed as an input to Evaluator to compose a runnable program or throw necessary
errors if it encounters any.

Clojure supports [202203061147](202203061147.md)#.

Polymorphism is supported by Clojure in the forms of function arities.
