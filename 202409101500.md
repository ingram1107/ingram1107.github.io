# Electronics Development Process

Development an electronic product generally should go through three phases:
**design phase**, **[prototype](202207120959.md) phase**, and **production
phase**.

In the design phase, we have to complete three stages, that is,
conceptualisation, research, and circuit design. Such design will be in the form
of circuit diagram or schematic diagram, showing components and interconnections
using standardised symbols.

Prototype phase consists of four stages, which are #hardware, mechanical, and
#software development, PCB layout, prototype building, and testing. It is common
to use solderless breadboard for prototyping.

Production phase consists of three stages, that is, production readiness review,
production, and ongoing maintenance. The product is often employed on printed
circuit boards (PCBs).
