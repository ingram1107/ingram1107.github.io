# Linear Block Coding

Linear Block Coding is an #[Error Control Coding](202211032201.md) using $(n,
k)$ linear [Block Code](202210290914.md)# where $k$ is the number of message
bits and $n$ is the number of codeword bits. The first portion of $k$ bits is
always identical to the message sequence to be transmitted. The total number of
code word could be derived by computing $2^k$. The second portion is a $n - k$
bits generalised *parity check bits* or *parity bits*. They are computed from
the message bits using an encoding rule shown later. The basic property of
Linear Block Coding is *closure*, where the sum of any two codes results in
another code word.

The code structure is shown below using equations:

$$
\begin{align}
c_i &= \begin{cases}
b_i & i=0,1,2,\ldots,n-k-1\\
m_{i+k-n} & i=n-k,n-k+1,\ldots,n-1
\end{cases}\\
b_i &= p_{0i}m_0 + p_{1i}m_1 + \ldots + p_{k-1,i}m_{k-1}\\
p_{ij} &= \begin{cases}
1 & \text{ if } b_i \text{ depends on } m_j\\
0 & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $b$ is the parity bit
- $m$ is the message bit
- $p$ is the coefficient in such a way that $n-k$ parity equations are unique
  and the rows of the [Generator Matrix](202211050947.md)#, $G$ are linearly
  independent (no other can expressed in similar linear combination)

We could express them into a compact form using matrix notation:

$$
\begin{align}
m &= [ m_0 \quad m_1 \quad \ldots \quad m_{k-1} ]\\
b &= [ b_0 \quad b_1 \quad \ldots \quad b_{n-k-1} ]\\
c &= [ c_0 \quad c_1 \quad \ldots \quad c_{n-1} ]\\
\end{align}
$$

Which we'll get $b = mP$ where $P$, the $k$ by $n-k$ coefficient matrix is
defined below:

$$
P = \left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
p_{00} & p_{01} & p_{02} & \cdots & p_{0,n-k-1}\\
p_{10} & p_{11} & p_{12} & \cdots & p_{1,n-k-1}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots\\
p_{k-1,0} & p_{k-1,1} & p_{k-1,2} & \cdots & p_{k-1,,n-k-1}
\end{array} \right]
$$

We can express the $c$ as a partitioned row vector, and substitute $b$ with
$mP$. And we can further factor out the $m$ from the equation, thus get the
following simplified formulae, which is the equation used to generate a full set
code words:

$$
\begin{align}
c &= [ b \vdots m ] = [ mP \vdots m ]\\
c &= m [ P \vdots I_k ]\\
c &= mG
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $I_k$ is the $k$ by $k$ [identity matrix](202211041921.md)#
- $G$ is the [Generator Matrix](202211050947.md)#

The parity bits will be checked against on the receiver side using the
mathematical relationship of the *parity bit* and *message bit* represented by
[Parity-Check Matrix](202212201918.md)#.

Utilising the nature of $H^T$, we could have a *parity check equation* based on
the encoding formula:

$$
cH^T = mGH^T = 0
$$

We can calculate the [Minimum Distance](202211162110.md)# of a linear block code
by finding the minimum [Hamming Weight](202211122222.md)# of any non-zero code
word in the code. And from here, we can know the error detection capability of a
linear block code, $\varepsilon$ with the equation:

$$
\varepsilon = d_{\text{min}} - 1
$$

Other than that, we can know the error correcting capability of a linear block
code $t$ with the equation:

$$
t \le \left \lfloor \frac{1}{2} (d_{\text{min}} - 1) \right \rfloor
$$
