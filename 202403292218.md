# Critical Word First and Early Restart

Critical Word First and Early Restart is a technique that allows memory
controller to request words of cache line in different order. The processor can
communicate the critical word that the program is waiting on.

There is a limit on this technique, as in the case of [data prefetching](202403210909.md),
critical word is not known by the processor. It has to wait for the critical
word without influencing the order during the prefetching. The position of the
critical word also matters.
