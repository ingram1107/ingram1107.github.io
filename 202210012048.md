# Decapsulation

Decapsulation is a process of **removing control information** as it passes down
through the layered model such as [Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md)#
and [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md)#. It is in direct
contrast to [Encapsulation](202210012046.md).
