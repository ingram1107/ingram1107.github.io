# Routing Information Protocol (RIP)

RIP is a #[classful](202210152242.md) #[Distance Vector Routing Protocol](202207071001.md)
that use hop count as metric to find out the routing path. The underlying
#algorithm used is the Bellman-Ford Algorithm. If the metric of route is larger
than 15, RIP will count it as unreachable. Routing updates are done via
broadcast IP address. It can only run on [IPv4](202206151453.md) networks, in
order to run [IPv6](202206281129.md) one needs to deploy RIPng (RIP next
generation) instead. There is a [classless](202210152246.md) implementation of
RIP: [RIP version 2 (RIPv2)](202211060854.md)#.

RIP will periodically broadcast the router's routing table to its neighbours'
#[port](202206151841.md) 520 every 30 seconds (default). The RIP message is
transferred using #[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md). There are
two types of message: request message and response message. Request message is
sent out on startup by RIP enable interface which requests all RIP enabled
neighbours to send routing table to it. Response message on the other hand is
the response to the request message, which sends the data containing routing
table to the requesting interface.

RIP only propagate the network address of known routes. There is no need to
include subnet mask as part of the routing information since it could determine
the subnet mask by just looking at the [Address Classes](202206280922.md)
default subnet masks. The boundary [Router](202207061800.md) (the entry router
to the RIP network) will summarise the RIP subnets from the internal network to
the external network. This reduces the size of the [Routing Table](202210112056.md)
and resulted in a faster lookup in the routing table (single route can represent
multiple routes). However, it comes at a cost of not able to support
discontiguous network. Furthermore, if the subnet mask doesn't match the class
or a subnet of the class, RIP will not advertise the route to the other RIP
enabled routers.

It could be enabled in #[Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md)
using the command `router rip`. To redistribute or advertising the routes in the
routing table, we could run the command `redistribute static`.
