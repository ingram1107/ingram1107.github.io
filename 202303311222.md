# Second-Generation Cellular Network (2G)

Invented in the late 1980s, 2G provides digital transmission for voices and
sometimes low-speed [Circuit Switched](202207150846.md) data (9.6 Kbps). Other
than that, it supports [encryption](202209281121.md), error detection and
correction (better data quality), and allows dynamic channel sharing among
multiple users. It can be divided into high-tier (GSM, IS-95 with
[CDMA](202303302113.md)) and low-tier (PCS). The low-tier 2G service provides
low-cost, low-power, and low-[Mobility](202303292141.md) services. For 2G and
[onwards](202303292214.md), multimedia data such as video, data, and fax can be
integrated into a single system, and has better compression which lead to better
channel utilisation.

Examples of 2G technologies:
- [Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](202304111937.md)
- Interim Standard 95 (IS-95, CDMA)
- Interim Standard 136 (IS-136, TDMA)
- PCS
