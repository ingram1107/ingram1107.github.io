# Second-Generation Cellular Network (2G)

Invented in the late 1980s, 2G provides digital transmission for voices and
sometimes low-speed [Circuit Switched](202207150846.md) data (9.6 Kbps). Other
than that, it supports [encryption](202209281121.md), error detection and
correction, and allows dynamic channel sharing among multiple users. It can be
divided into high-tier (GSM, IS-95 with [CDMA](202303302113.md)) and low-tier
(PCS). The low-tier 2G service provides low-cost, low-power, and
low-[Mobility](202303292141.md) services.

Examples of 2G technologies:
- Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM, TDMA)
- Interim Standard 95 (IS-95, CDMA)
- Interim Standard 136 (IS-136, TDMA)
- PCS
