# Crash Program Earlier

Crashing the program earlier has two advantages: the program is dead, and the
resources are reclaimed by the system. A dead program is better than a crippled
one. [The Pragmatic Programmer](lit/@Hunt1999.md)

To do this, always check the return value of a function or method of a class
with the expected value. Crash the program as soon as there's a problem.
Combining with some software engineering practices such as
[Design by Contract (DBC)](202206301938.md), it will give a strong guarantee that the system
will not put up unexpected operations.

We can quickly do this using a [macro function](202205241310.md)# :

```c
#define CHECK(LINE, EXPECTED)                       \
{                                                   \
int rc = LINE;                                      \
if (rc != EXPECTED)                                 \
ut_abort(__FILE__, __LINE__, #LINE, rc, EXPECTED);  \
}

void ut_abort(char *file, int ln, char *line, int rc, int exp) {
fprintf(stderr, "%s line %d\n'%s': expected %d, got %d\n",
        file,
        ln,
        line,
        exp,
        rc);
exit(1);
}
```
