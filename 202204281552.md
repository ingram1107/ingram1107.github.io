# Ordered Pair

An ordered pair $(a, b)$ is a pair of objects or a #[202204281446](202204281446.md) of two sets
that is ordered, as defined by Kuratowski $\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}$.

Since the sequence is important for an ordered pair, an ordered pair $(a, b)$ is
equal to another ordered pair $(c, d)$, if and only if $a = c$ and $b = d$.
