# Syndrome Decoding

Syndrome Decoding is a #[decoding technique](202209291049.md) to correct some
errors, especially those with high probability, cause by noisy channel. It does
this by comparing $r$, a received vector of dimensions $1 \times n$, to
#[$H$](202212201918.md), the parity check matrix. $r$ is defined as:

$$
r = c + e
$$

Where:
- $c$ is the transmitted code vector
- $e$ is the *error vector* or *error pattern*

We calculate the syndrome $s$ from the following matrix multiplication:

$$
s = rH^T
$$

Where:
- $H^T$ is the transpose version of $H$

The syndrome $s$ has some properties:
- It depends only on the error pattern $e$ and not on the transmitted code word
  $c$. If there are errors occur in transmission, then the syndrome is non-zero.
  Otherwise, the syndrome is a zero vector.
- A single $i$-th bit error in $c$ will lead to a vector $s$ that would be
  identical to $i$-th row in $H^T$. According to this information, we can
  correct the $i$-th bit in the $r$ which will lead us to the $c$. However, this
  will work only for **single errors** in transmission.
- With syndrome decoding a $(n,k)$ #[linear block code](202211041839.md) can
  correct up to $t$ errors per code word, provided that $n$ and $k$ satisfy the
  Hamming bound.
