# Kerckhoff's Principle

Kerckhoff's Principle stated that the #[Cryptography](202209281121.md) method
must be secure in an environment based on the following 2 assumptions:
1. The system, that is the #algorithm, is publicly known
2. The key is secret at all time

That is, in order to have a secure cryptography method, it must secure the key,
which is the only private part of the entire system. Failure to protect the key
will result in the total compromise of the system.
