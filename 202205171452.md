# restrict

`restrict` is a C keyword that particularly used on pointer in order to restrict
it to only access the object that it is pointing to. For example, when the
`restrict` keyword is used as below on two pointer parameters in a function:

```c
int function(char* restrict ptr1, char* restrict ptr2);
```

`ptr1` cannot be at the same time pointing to the object that is pointed by
`ptr2`. This is a known pattern in order to constrain the [aliasing](202205171500.md)#.
