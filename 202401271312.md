# Amazon Auto Scaling

Auto Scaling utilises **Auto Scaling group** as a logical grouping of AWS
resources for automatic scaling and management. Its size is depended on the
*desired capacity* set by the user, and will scale accordingly to the *minimum
size* and *maximum size* configured.

In the case of [AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](202401152149.md), Auto Scaling
uses launch template which consists of several variables for the launch
configuration. These variables include AMI, instance type,
[IAM](202312131707.md) role, security groups, and [EBS](202401182023.md)
volumes. Then launch it into a subnet within a [VPC](202401042139.md) which can
be attached with [load balancers](202401270917.md). After that, we may specify
which scaling policy we want to implement, they are: maintain current instance
levels (perform health checks and replacement only), manual scaling, scheduled
scaling (scheduled action), dynamic scaling, or predictive scaling.

In AWS terminology, launching new instances is called *scaling out*, while
terminating instances is called *scaling in*.
