# Modus Tollens

Modus Tollens, means "method of denial" in Latin, is a form of #[202206101739](202206101739.md) in which the conclusion is a denial. It takes the following form:
 
$$
\begin{align}
&\text{If } p \text{ then } q \\
&\sim q \\
\therefore \ &\sim p\end{align}
$$

Note the similarity with the contrapositive of the [202205062055](202205062055.md). Therefore, we can know that Modus Tollens is [logically equivalent](202205061231.md) to [202206101747](202206101747.md).

We can prove the validity of it by contradiction. Suppose we are analysing the following #[202205062050](202205062050.md):
1. If Zeus is human, then Zeus is mortal
2. Zeus is not mortal

From the above premises, if Zeus were human, then by (1) he would be mortal. However, by (2) he is not mortal. Therefore, he cannot be human.
