# I/O Subsystem

I/O subsystem provides an abstraction on I/O devices for the kernels and
establishes a uniform access method to a variety of peripherals. It defines a
standard set of functions for I/O operations. The driver that supports uniform
I/O will be able to [map](202407012228.md) the API set to its specific function
set.
