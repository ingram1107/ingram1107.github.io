# std::expected

`std::expected` is a [C++23](202302190651.md) feature that is similar with
`[std::optional](202204181637.md)`, including the support of [Higher-Order Function (HOF)](202304241202.md),
with the additional parameter of accepting an error value or unexpected value.
Using alongside with its sibling `std::unexpected`, we can achieve low-overhead
exception handling. It can even be done with `std::variant` and `std::visit` for
conditional branching.
