# The Reign of Caliph Uthman bin Affan

Uthman bin Affan was elected as [Caliph](202302181011.md) by the Consultative
Supreme Council. During his reign, the manuscript of Al-Quran was compiled and
released as the version of Mushaf Uthman (the copy of Al-Quran by Uthman). Iran,
part of Northern Africa and Cyprus all fell to the Caliphate during this time.
That being said, some, especially those of Shi'a, accused Uthman of nepotism as
he selected those that were close to him as the governors for regions unlike in
the period of [The Reign of Caliph Umar bin Al-Khattab](202302190619.md). This
might be due to his family background as a merchant that didn't familiar with
the politics and military matters, and gave great autonomies to his generals and
governors. In 656, due to discontent of his nepotism and exploitative rule of
the governors, the rebels rose up and demand the resignation of Uthman as
Caliph. [Ali bin Abi Talib](202302241134.md) was sent to negotiate with the
rebels, with the promise of removal of the unpopular Abdullah bin Saad, the
foster brother of Uthman, in favour of Muhammad bin Abu Bakar, the son of the
[first Caliph](202302181017.md), as the Egyptian governor. At first, the
negotiation went well, but when the rebels heard of rumours from Uthman to
execute them, they went back and killed the Caliph at his home, guarded by Ali
and his two sons, Hassan and Hussain.
