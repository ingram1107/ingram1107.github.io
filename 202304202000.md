# Online Processing

Online processing is a one-for-one interaction (one response to exactly one
request) between the client and the system. It produces a near-immediate
response to the client as the server doesn't need much processing power to serve
a single request. However, it comes with the cost of #networking, processing,
and data storage #resource [Requirement](202303251303.md). Furthermore, because
of its high interactivity, the server is in constant starves of data which bring
down the computer #resource utilisation. An example of online processing is the
automated teller machine (ATM) system.
