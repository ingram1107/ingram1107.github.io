# Switching Fabric

Switching fabric is an interconnected network that is responsible to connect
input ports and output ports within a [Router](202207061800.md). There are three
common implementations for switching fabric:
- **Switching via memory**. In this implementation, input and output ports are
  treated as I/O devices which are under router's CPU direct control. All
  signalling on arrived packets are done through interrupt, which then will
  store those packets into the memory waiting for the CPU to retrieve them.
- **Switching via bus**. Input ports are directly connected to output ports via
  a single, shared bus. Certainly, the limiting factor to improve the router's
  switching #performance is the bus's bandwidth.
- **Switching via crossbar**. Building an interconnection network comprises $2n$
  buses for $n$ input ports and $n$ output ports. This resolve the limitation of
  the shared bus's bandwidth.

**Note**: If the bandwidth of the memory is $B/s$, then the
[Throughput](202304111957.md) must be less than $B/2$.
