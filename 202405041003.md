# Implementation of Semaphore in Mailbox

If the OS doesn't have [Semaphore](202404302127.md) primitives to deploy binary
semaphore, one can implement it in the fashion of [Mailbox](202405040951.md)
using dummy mail. Two operations, `wait()` and `signal()`, must be implemented
for this to work. The following #c code shows the concept:

```c
void wait(int s)
{
    int key = 0;
    pend(key, &s);
}

void signal(int s)
{
    int key = 0
    post(key, &s);
}
```
