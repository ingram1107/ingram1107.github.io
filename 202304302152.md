# Software Validation

Software validation is an activity of comparing the software product produced at
the output of each phase of the [life cycle](202303251030.md) currently at with
the product produced at the output of the previous phase. The latter will be the
input to the next phase and a specification for it. In short, it is to test if
we are doing the right product.
