# Visitor Pattern

Visitor Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) trying to isolate
operation details done on objects into separate hierarchy instead of couple them
into the class itself. This satisfies the [SOLID](202202041514.md) principle as
the object class is intact from future changes from addition of operations. This
design pattern involves two class hierarchies: the **element** hierarchy which
implements a `accept()` operation that takes a visitor as an argument, and the
**visitor** hierarchy which implement the operations (each operation is their
own class) on the **element** depending on their type.

The Gang of Four suggested to use Visitor when:
1. There is a need to perform operations on many classes of objects with
   different interfaces.
2. There are many distinct and unrelated operations need to be performed on
   objects that seem polluting or smell.
3. The element hierarchy is rarely change, but there is a need to add operations
   on them frequently.

Despite the advantages of avoiding modifying the type classes every time there
is a need for additional operation, Visitor design pattern is not ideal for type
extension, that is introducing new subclass to the element hierarchy. An
alternative of Visitor in [C++](202302190651.md) is to use `std::variant` for
type extension and `std::visitor` for creating Visitor without the usage of base
classes. Both of them use procedural approach (that is `switch` branching) to
extend the types and operations on the types. This approach avoids the
#performance penalty from using two virtual functions due to the need of base
classes.
