# Rehashing

Rehashing is a method for #[202112122035](202112122035.md) to resize the original Table
into a bigger one, usually twice as large. This is usually used alongside with
#[202112131222](202112131222.md)

## Details

Rehashing the Table will build a new Table that is twice as larger than the
original Table with a new [202112122038](202112122038.md). All the elements will be recomputed
to a new hash value and inserted into the new Table.

## Analysis

- Will result in $O(N)$

## Implementation

There are different strategies to rehash:
- Rehash as soon as the Table reach half full
- Rehash only when insertion fails
- Rehash when reaches certain [202112141222](202112141222.md)

```c
HashTable Rehash(HashTable H) {
  int OldSize;
  Cell *OldCells;

  OldCells = H->TheCells;
  OldSize = H->TableSize;

  // Get a new, empty table
  H = InitializeTable(2 * OldSize);

  // Scan through old table, reinserting into new
  for (int i = 0; i < OldSize; i++)
    if (OldCells[i].Info == Legitimate)
      Insert(OldCells[i].Element, H);

  free(OldCells);

  return H;
}
```
