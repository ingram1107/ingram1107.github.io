# Python Resource Clean Up

Python will clean up object upon the reference count down to 0 if it is not
strongly referred by other object.

We can clean up class objects by using `weakref.finalize`. **Avoid** using the
dunder `__del__` for resource clean-up since such clean-up is not guarantee by
the interpreter. It is shown as follow:

```python
class TempDir:
  def __init__(self):
    # shutil.rmtree guarantees the object will be clean up by garbage collector
    self._finalizer = weakref.finalize(self, shutil.rmtree, self.name)

  def remove(self):
    self._finalizer()

  @property
  def removed(self):
    return not self._finalizer.alive
```

We can further guarantee a clean-up upon exception by utilising
#[202206071327](202206071327.md):

```python
  # for `with ... as ...`
  def __enter__(self):
    return self

  # for `with ... as ...`
  def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    self.remove()
```
