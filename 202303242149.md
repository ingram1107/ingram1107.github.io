# System Integration (SI)

SI is the process of coupling different [computer systems](202303242148.md) and
#software applications physically or functionally (breakdown of comprising
parts) to act as a complete system (relationships between the parts). Another
definition suggests that SI is a logical, objective procedure for applying new
and/or expanded performance [Requirements](202303251303.md) in an efficient,
timely manner to the design, installation, and operation of an operational
#configuration consisting of distinct modules or subsystems, each of which may
embody inherent [constraints](202303250956.md) or limitations. A good SI is
clear to the observer via the means of audit trailing for every step, don't slow
down by delay and bureaucratic procedures, employed throughout the entire system
integration life cycle, and well-connected to previous and future components. It
provides flexibility, speed, cost, standardisation, [Data Integrity](202210040913.md),
reliability and robustness, new products and services, and prevent proprietary
lock-in by vendors.

System integrator should have general business concepts, technical skills
(computers, networks, #software), and soft skills (communication, leadership,
#planning, accounting, finance). They have to conduct the general studies of
needs to realise improved system #performance, then leverage this knowledge to
develop detailed [specifications](202304011057.md) and
[designs](202304011211.md). Risk studies should be conducted to deploy suitable
risk minimisation strategies. They have to perform system analysis and design,
and after that develop #hardware and software design and specification. Employ
[project planning](202303251009.md) and control, then perform business
management and accounting. Relationships with customers and subcontractors is
within the responsibility of a system integrator, so they need to develop and
nurture them. [Configuration management](202205041217.md) and [testing](202206201159.md)
should be done. The technology based solutions developed should adhere to the
business needs. They also have to train the users to use the new systems.

There are several methods of system integration that will be shown below. The
common aims of these methods are to support [problem understanding](202304152132.md)
and #communication between all parties at all stages of development, enable
capture of design and implementation needs early (interface and
[interactive](202303242118.md)), support both top-down and
[bottom-up](202202041514.md) design philosophy, full compliance with audit trail
needs, system-level quality assurance and risk assessment and evaluation,
definition and #documentation of all program aspects, and provide framework for
appropriate system management application to all program aspects:
- [Vertical Integration](202304301159.md)
- [Horizontal Integration](202304301212.md)
- [Star Integration](202304301223.md)
