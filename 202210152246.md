# Classless Routing Protocols

Classless Routing Protocols are the [Routing Protocols](202207061815.md) that
don't follow the [Address Classes](202206280922.md) subnet masking instead
favour the [Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)](202210162049.md)#. All
protocols will include network mask when sending the routing information to
other [Network Device](202207051821.md). It is aimed to replace
[Classful Routing Protocols](202210152242.md).

Examples of Classless Routing Protocols:
- [RIP version 2 (RIPv2)](202211060854.md)#
- EIGRP
- OSPFv2
- [Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)](202210160858.md)#
- BGPv4
