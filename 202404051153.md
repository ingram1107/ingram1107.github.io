# von Neumann Architecture

von Neumann Architecture is a [Computer Architecture](202403151651.md) where
instruction and data shared the common [memory](202403132022.md). Since both
instruction and data competes with the bandwidth of the memory bus, it creates
a bottleneck (*von Neumann bottleneck*). The CPU designers try to overcome this
by assigning [CPU Cache](202403191017.md) to the processor. Furthermore,
accidental program memory corruption can happen as data memory and program are
stored together in the same memory.
