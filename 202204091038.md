# Atomicity of a Note

A note should present a complete idea. This does not mean that we should drop
everything into a single page in order to understand a topic fully. The note
should have enough sentences or paragraphs to present an idea and the idea only.

Sure that there will be a lot of contexts lost while creating a note, but with
the help of #[Zettelkasten](202110160303.md) it should be easy to create those
contexts into notes where the original note could make links to them. In this
way, we do not lost the contexts at all. We just hide the contexts for brevity
which we could do our revision more quickly. This is sometimes called
**Progressive Summarization**.
