# On Romance Relationship

The highest form of romance relationship is that one could express their love in
their own ways at the same time completely understood by their partner where
such happen in a bidirectional way. This should be the one and only aim for a
healthy romance relationship.

One would argue that marriage, rather than pursuing such idealistic fantasy,
should be the aim for a relationship since it is less abstract and easy to
grasp. I disagree such view in the sense that relationship does not and should
not end at marriage. Marriage is just a contract for a couple to consent on a
long-term commitment to the relationship. It is never about the relationship
itself.

It is the same as placing having a family as relationship goal. There is nothing
wrong on them, just that it does not come to the realisation that relationship
will last down the one's grave and persist in the memories of others.
