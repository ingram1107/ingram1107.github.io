# Project Quality Management

In project quality management, it is important to establish a mutual consensus
between the developer team and the customer on the product quality. It involves
three processes which are **planning quality management**, **performing quality
assurance**, and **controlling quality**.

During the quality management planning, we have to identify the relevant quality
[Requirements](202303251303.md) and [standards](202305151526.md) (system growth,
reasonable response time, consistent and accurate output) to the project and
plan to work towards them. Examples of the outputs from this activity are
quality management and process improvement plan, quality metrics, quality
checklists, and project document updates.

After the planning, we should start performing the [Quality Assurance (QA)](202304302045.md)
to periodically evaluating the overall project performance, so that we can know
how the progress the project adhering the relevant quality standards. Examples
of outputs are request changes, project management plan, documents, and
organisational process asset updates,

At the end of the quality management, we need to control the quality which
involves monitoring specific project results to ensure that they comply with
relevant quality standards while identifying ways to improve overall quality.
The main outcomes from the activity are acceptance decisions (accept or reject),
rework (after reject, try to comply with the quality standards again), and
process adjustments (correct or prevent further quality problems by updating
quality baseline, organisation process assets, and [project management plan](202305061844.md)).
