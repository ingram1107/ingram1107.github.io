# Distributed Processing

Distributed processing breaks down large volume of data into smaller pieces,
which is then distributed in many locations to be processed by local computers.
Each computer in the distributed architecture analyses its part of the
[Big Data](202409100010.md) picture (horizontal scaling).

Example of distributed processing software:
