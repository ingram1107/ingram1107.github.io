# Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)

ISR, or more commonly known as interrupt handler, is responsible for saving
additional processor state information, switching to an
[Exception](202405222000.md) frame or interrupt stack, and masking the current
interrupt level. It performs a minimum amount of work such that a dedicated task
can complete the main processing.
