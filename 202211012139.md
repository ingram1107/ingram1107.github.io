# Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)

S/MIME is an extension to the existing [MIME](202211012200.md)# email
infrastructure focus on security enhancements in [Application Layer](202206131856.md)#
which is supported in many mail agents such as MS Outlook, Mozilla, Mac Mail
etc. It is similar to [Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)](202210312227.md) which offers
ability to sign and/or encrypt messages. The public keys are distributed in the
form of [Public-Key Certificate](202210122233.md)# which both parties have to
obtain the cert.

It provides several additional content-types for MIME email:
- Enveloped data which data and associated keys are encrypted
- Signed data which the digest is signed and the message is encoded
- Clear-signed data which digest is signed and encoded
- Signed and enveloped data where there are nesting of signed and encrypted
  entities
- Registration request which is used to apply [Public-Key Certificate](202210122233.md)#
  from CA
- Certificate-only message which is issued by the CA to the user

S/MIME utilises several [Cryptographic](202209281121.md) schemes to provide
secrecy to the MIME email. For [Digital Signature](202210040909.md)#, it uses
DDS or [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)#. [Hash Functions](202112122038.md)#
used are SHA-1 and MD5. ElGamal or [Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md)# 
is used to encrypt session key. The message encryption is done by
[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)#, [Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)](202209012209.md)#,
RC2/40 or others.
