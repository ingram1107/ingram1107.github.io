# Autovivification

Autovivification is a Perl term, stated if a variable hasn't been created before
being used by a function, then it will initialised as `undef` which means
undefined. If such variable is being used in a function, it will be converted
into 0 or an empty string (""), which means [false](202207211219.md)# in Perl,
depending on the context. It can be a good thing to have, but it is not for all
situations. It is suggested to import standard libraries `warnings` and `strict`
to show undefined variables as warnings when interpreted by Perl.
