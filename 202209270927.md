# Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

ICMP, defined in RFC 792, carries network information, primarily error and
control messages, with #[Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md) datagram as a
payload over a network in the case such as unavailable service and unreachable
host.

Its header has a type and code field, which contains the header and the first 8
bytes of the IP datagram that generate the ICMP message.

In version 6, i.e., ICMPv6, defined in RFC 2463, it subsumes
[IGMP](202209271135.md) functionalities.

Command `ping`, exists in #windows and [Linux](202204081225.md)#, utilises ICMP
to detect the response time and time to live (TTL) of the target destination to
the source.
