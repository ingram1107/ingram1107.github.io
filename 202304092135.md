# Jitter

Jitter is the small variances of delay. To overcome it, we can deploy
*timestamp* or *jitter buffer*. The former is attached to every piece of data by
the sender so that the receiver can handle out-of-order packets and display them
in the correct time sequence. The latter can be deployed at the receiver side to
buffer data and delay playback.
