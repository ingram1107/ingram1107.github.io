# Jitter

Jitter is the small variances or changes of [delay](202304111955.md) and the
duration of changes. It can be measured by the command `ping` with the result
from the parameter `stddev` or `mdev` of the `[round-trip](202303292133.md)` or
`rtt` in #windows and [Linux](202204081225.md) respectively. There are generally
two ways to handle the jitter: design an [isochronous network](202304171904.md)
with no jitter which is expensive, or use a [protocol](202304092140.md) that
compensates for jitter. To overcome it in [Transport Layer](202206131837.md), we
can deploy *timestamp* or *[jitter buffer](202304120800.md)*. The former is
attached to every piece of data by the sender so that the receiver can handle
out-of-order packets and display them in the correct time sequence. The latter
can be deployed at the receiver side to buffer data and delay playback.
