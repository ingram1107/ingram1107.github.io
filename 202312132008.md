# AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

All newly created AWS S3 buckets are private by default (accessed only by the
users that are granted access to). We can use *Amazon S3 Block Public Access*,
*[IAM policies](202312131707.md)*, *bucket policies*, *[Access Control List (ACL)](202302190738.md)*
(legacy), or AWS Trust Advisor to manage and control S3 access policies.
