# Delegation

Delegation is a way of making [Object Composition](202302051222.md) as powerful
for reuse as inheritance. The concept is simple: the object delegates or defers
the operations or requests to its delegate, that is another object. However,
only use Delegation when necessary as the behaviour of an object could be hard
to understand.
