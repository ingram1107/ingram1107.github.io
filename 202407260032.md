# Pair Programming

Pair programming defines two roles for a pair of programmers: a driver who
writes the code and a navigator who gives the feedback to the driver (by
observing, checking, or looking at the big picture). The role is recommended to
be switched regularly so that both can learn from each perspective. Since it
requires constant interactions between the driver and the navigator,
communication is essential in shaping the effectiveness of pair programming.

If the skill gap between the driver and the navigator are too great, especially
in the case when you are the navigator, the driver should be given more autonomy
and free hand on writing the codes and correcting them by themselves. The
navigator only steps in when deem necessary.
