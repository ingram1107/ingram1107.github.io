# Computation Offloading

Computation offloading is a process of identifying, partitioning, and migrating
resource-intensive components of [mobile](202401282045.md) applications to
[cloud](202210012158.md)-based resources. It could be either **static**
(one-time identification and partitioning process at design and development
time), **dynamic** (at runtime), or **hybrid** (adapt to environment).
