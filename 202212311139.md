# Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST)

PVST is a Cisco proprietary #[Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)](202207081637.md)
that supports VLAN segregation. It supports ISL for VLAN encapsulation. A newer
version of PVST, PVST+ supports [IEEE 802.1Q](202212251358.md)# as a mean for
VLAN encapsulation instead.

To speed up the forwarding state, Cisco also developed [Rapid Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (RPVST)](202212311146.md).
