# Null Object Pattern

Null Object Pattern is a #[Design Pattern](202211221249.md) where an object
explicit neutral behaviour and/or default values. It is usually useful to
introduce it by extends (or inherit) from an object that could have a null case.
Instead of relying on checking whether the object is null or not, we can create
a Null Object and check its behaviour. It simplifies the codebase and apparently
a great tool for #[Refactoring](202206032059.md).

An example of implementation of it using #cpp is presented as follows:

```cpp
class Animal {
  public:
    bool isNull(void) {
      return false;
    }
};

class NullAnimal : public Animal {  // NullAnimal extends Animal
  public:
    bool isNull(void) override {
      return true;
    }
}
```
