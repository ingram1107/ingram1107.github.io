# Figma Open Source Alternative

Figma is a propriatary UI/UX tool available as an web application for all
platforms. There are some good [open source](202110161031.md)# alternatives to
Figma for the same purpose and goal with more or less functionalities.

## Penpot

Penpot does provide most functionalities presented in Figma, with an additional
advantage over Adobe XD where it can change the canvas's background colour.
However, as for now, it doesn't support component states or micromanagement,
auto-layout and plugins.

You could create a template for a particular device creating a "Board". All UX
options for the components are available in "Prototype" section.

## Quant UX

Quant UX is a powerful UX tool. User can define a variable or constraint on a
component's action using logic element where it can produce a different result
accordingly. Moreover, it can integrate with web services such as REST API. It
also provides means to view [Performance Testing](202206201415.md)# results
gathered from user's interaction with the template. Mouse click action from the
user are tracked, in either the form of heatmap or continuous journey, which the
designer could view later on for [Usability Testing](202206201428.md)#.

It supports conversion from Figma and Zip archive format, and can export to #vue
, #css , and #html source.

## Plasmic

Plasmic has a great integration with #javascript framework such as React.js as
it provides various commands such as `plasmic init`, `plasmic sync --projects
{project-id}` and `plasmic watch`. Designers could view the live changes from
the code base as they are editing the template in Plasmic.
