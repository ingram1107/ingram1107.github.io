# Iterator Pattern

Iterator Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that can traverse
through a #data-structure such as [List](202110191710.md) and keep track of the
traversal state. Instead of assigning traverse operations and policies to the
*aggregate* class, that is the list, they are instead defined in the Iterator
class and be created by the aggregate class through *concrete aggregate* class
for its corresponding *concrete iterator* class by [Factory Method](202302232101.md).

The Gang of Four advised to use Iterator when:
- There is a need to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its
  internal representation
- There is a need to support multiple traversals of aggregate objects
- There is a need to provide polymorphic iteration (uniform interface for
  traversing different aggregate structures)

The Iterator can be implemented depends on the iterator control, either based on
the client (*external iterator*) or the Iterator itself (*internal iterator*,
with subclassing for item process algorithm or closures). It can be used to
traverse a [Composite](202302101843.md).

**Note**: The aggregate class must either adjust the internal state of
iterators it has produced, or it maintains information internally to ensure
proper traversal upon insertions and removals on the aggregate.

**Note**: The resource management of an iterator can be delegated to a
[Proxy](202303132109.md).
