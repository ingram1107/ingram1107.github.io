# RSVP with Traffic Engineering Extensions (RSVP-TE)

RSVP with Traffic Engineering Extensions (RSVP-TE) is an extension to
[Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)](202304261306.md) to support
[Label Distribution](202304261259.md) by the means of piggybacking the exchange
of labels in order to provide [dynamic traffic engineering](202305040730.md). It
requests bandwidth and traffic conditions on a defined path, but with the
drawbacks of regular refreshes and poor scalability.
