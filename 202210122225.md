# Publicly Available Directory

Publicly Available Directory is a public storage for #[public key retrieval](202203221212.md)
where participants could register keys in it. It must contain entries in the
form of name with associated public keys, periodically published and able to be
accessed electronically. The participants should register securely with the
directory and able to change their keys at any time. However, like
[Public Announcement](202210122221.md), it is still vulnerable to forgery.
