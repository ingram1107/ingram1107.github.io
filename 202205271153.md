# Showing Contributors

In #[202208131616](202208131616.md), there will always be a way to show and rank the
contributors.

## Git

We can show who contributes to the repository and which commits are by them.
This could be done by the command `git shortlog`. To shrink the information even
more, we can use the option `-s` which only show how many commits does one
contributed. Option `-n` can use to sort the information by numerical order
instead of alphabetical order to create a ranking.
