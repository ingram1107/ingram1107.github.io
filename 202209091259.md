# Multiplexing

Multiplexing is a method of combining multiple data streams onto a single
**physical** or **logical** connection such as a wire, [Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md)
link, or signals. Most of the time, the multiplexed data would be reconstructed
at the receiving end.

There are several that multiplexing could be implemented:
- [Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)](202209091302.md)
- [Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md)
- [Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)](202209091312.md)
- [Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)](202404111037.md)
