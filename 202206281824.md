# Dynamic NAT

Dynamic NAT is one of the implementations of #[NAT](202206281817.md) that maps
public address from pool to private address when it is *available* (first-come,
first-served). Such assignment will only last for a single communication
session, which means it will become available to the other local network devices
once the current device went down. This mechanism preserves address space. That
being said, it can still run out of public address if there are too many devices
request for the assignment.

It is good for security since the private address is not visible to the outside world.

To implement dynamic NAT, we have to create a pool with a mapping between the
inside local and outside local addresses with the command `ip nat pool {name}
{start-ip} {end-ip} netmask {network-mask}` or `ip nat pool {name} {start-ip}
{end-ip} prefix-length {prefix-length}`. Then, we create [ACL](202302190738.md)
to permit these addresses to be translated by executing the command `access-list
{number} permit {source-ip} {wildcard}`, which we later bind it to the pool with
the command `ip nat inside source list {acl-number} pool {name}`. Like in
[Static NAT](202206281819.md), we need to define in the [edge
router](202207061800.md) to distinguish between inside and outside interfaces.
