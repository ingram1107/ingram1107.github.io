# Git Rebase 

`rebase {target}` incorporates branches by manipulating the history of commits.
The result of it will be a linear and clean commits without divergences. All
commits of the current branch, if they do not contain duplicated commits in the
target branch, will be *attached* to the HEAD of the target branch.

These newly attached commits are the clone of the original commits which are
discarded like in [Git Reset](202204261452.md). However, you can still see them in
Git Reflog.

**Note**: `rebase {target} {source}` will automatically check out to the source
branch first before rebase it to the target branch. It is a shorthand of
`checkout {source}` follow by `rebase {target}`.

It is useful for feature development and bug fixes especially if these are split
from a branch. Note the similarity to [202204261123](202204261123.md) but the latter focus on
preserving the merge history rather than having a clean commit history.

When using the interactive mode, `-i`, `rebase` could arbitrarily choose which
commits should be applied and what order should they be in. This is suitable for
history rearrangement. It shares some similarity with [202204261212](202204261212.md). However,
the latter does not *incorporate* branches.
