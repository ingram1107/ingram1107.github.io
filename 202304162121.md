# Statement of Work (SOW)

SOW is a description of work required for the [procurement](202304161643.md)
(acquisition of goods or services). Many [contracts](202304161649.md) include
SOW, especially the good one, to give the seller a better understanding of the
customer's expectation.

An example of SOW template might include:
1. Scope of work (specify #hardware and #software involved)
2. Location of work
3. Period of performance
4. Deliverables schedule
5. Applicable standards
6. Acceptance criteria
7. Special requirements
