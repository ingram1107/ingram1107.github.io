# IEEE 802.16

IEEE 802.16 uses [licensed spectrum](202302161842.md) with microwave or
millimetre wave radios. It is capable of [Broadband](202208311155.md)
transmission (more than 2 Mbps), metropolitan in scale, and provides public
network services to fee-paying customers. It also provides efficient transport
of heterogenous traffic supporting [Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md).
The underlying architecture adopts point-to-multipoint model with stationary
rooftop or tower-mounted antennas.

Its protocol architecture consists of, from top to bottom, **convergence
layer**, **[MAC](202303301623.md) layer**, **transmission layer**, and
**physical layer**. Both convergence and MAC layer are equivalent to [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md),
and both transmission and physical layer are equivalent to [Physical Layer](202206131647.md).

Convergence layer is responsible for [PDU](202206131643.md) framing from upper
layers encapsulation into native 802.16 MAC or PHY frames, mapping of upper
layer's addresses into 802.16 addresses, translation of upper layer
[QoS](202209282057.md) parameters into native MAC format, and conversion of
upper layer traffic time dependencies into equivalent MAC service. Coming to MAC
layer, it is actually comprised of three sublayers which are Convergence
Sublayer (CS, transforms or maps packets, either receive through Service Access
Point, SAP), Common Part Layer (CPS, contains core functions of system access,
bandwidth allocation, connection maintenance, and establishment), and security
sublayer ([Authentication](202210022151.md) and [key exchange](202209012218.md)).
MAC layer has to assemble data into frame with address and error detection
fields on transmission, disassemble frame then perform address recognition and
error detection on reception, and govern access to [Wireless Network Communication Media](202302161842.md).
Last but not least, physical and transmission layers are responsible for signal
encoding and decoding, preamble generation and removal, and bit transmission and
reception.

IEEE 802.16.1 defines line-of-sight (LOS) services like digital audio or video
multicast, digital telephony, [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md),
[Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md), bridged [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md),
back-haul, and [Frame Relay](202208291308.md). IEEE 802.16.3 non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) defines voice transport, data transport, and bridged LAN.
