# Timer

Timer is a specialised clock to measure time interval. Its main component is a
free-running binary [Counter](202404061109.md), which often connected to capture
register. The capture register automatically loads the current output of the
free-running counter upon occurrence of some event, usually a signal to an input
pin. It then latches the value to a processor-visible register, later used to
generate an output signal. The following figure shows the design of such timer:
