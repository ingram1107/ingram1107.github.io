# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is a method designed to negotiating and passing
encrypted by #[Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md) or
[Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md)# cryptographic keys over an insecure
network. The keys intended to be shared will not be transmitted in plain text,
and instead encrypted by a shared secret key which in turned generated from two
known prime numbers that have a special #math relationship to one another.

Both parties will retain their own private keys, with a pair of public keys that
is encrypted with their corresponding private keys. The encrypted public keys
will be shared to each other over an insecure channel. They will encrypt the
public keys (now it's not their own) again using the private keys, which will
resulted in same public keys that only both parties know. When both parties
obtain back their public key, they could decrypt it and obtain the opposite
private key. [^computerphile2017]
