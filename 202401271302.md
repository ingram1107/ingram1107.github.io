# Amazon CloudWatch

CloudWatch monitors AWS resources and applications that run on AWS in real time.
It tracks and collects metrics regarding the resources used by utilising a
custom alarm set by user to automatically push an Amazon Simple Notification
Service (SNS) or perform Auto Scaling or action ([EC2](202401152149.md)). We
could also use Events to define rules that match incoming events or changes in
AWS environment and route them to one or more target functions or streams for
processing.
