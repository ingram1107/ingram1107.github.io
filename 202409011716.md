# Rotation of Duties

Rotation of duties is a form of [Security Control](202408221618.md) that
minimises fraud, defined by National Computer Network Emergency Response
Technical Team â€“ Coordination Centre of Chine (CNCERT/CC). It prevents possible
fraud, misuse of resources, or jeopardise [Data Integrity](202210040913.md) due
to extended periods of job position held by a single personnel. This method also
helps manage employee's level of motivation.

CNCERT/CC recommends those of holding senstive positions should be directed to
consume their annual leave. Any error or fraud can be detected during the period
of employee absence.

Separation of duties is a variation of such policies to ensure split knowledge
and/or dual control. With split knowledge, it is required to have teamwork to
complete a single task since no one has monopoly on the knowledge performing the
task. Dual control required two or more individuals to perform a task at any one
time.
