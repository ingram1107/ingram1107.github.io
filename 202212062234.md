# Switched LAN Architecture

In a typical [Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md)# network, it is
designed as a [Hierarchical Network](202207071052.md)# involving multiple
[Switches](202207051907.md)# with three layers: **core layer**, **distribution
layer**, **access layer**. Access layer consists of end devices, and defines a
basic configuration and constraint on them on network connection. Distribution
layer is where we will define routing policies, [Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)#,
access control, broadcast domains, and access layer traffic aggregation or
funnelling. Core layer should be capable of handling large amounts of traffic
with high performance, this means that it needs to be highly
[available](202210022157.md) and redundant. For cost saving, we can collapse or
combine distribution layer and core layer into one single layer.

**Note**: Avoid redundancy at access layer due to the cost and variety of
devices.

**Note**: If user applications need higher bandwidth than a single switch link
could allow, it is useful to aggregates multiple switch port links (up to 8 GB)
together in order to provide higher throughput between switches especially if
they have bandwidth discrepancies. See [Hierarchical Network](202207071052.md)#.
