# Label-Switched Path (LSP)

LSP is a predetermined network path for [MPLS](202207150852.md) packets. It is a
representation of a [Forwarding Equivalence Classes (FEC)](202209282123.md).
However, such setup is unidirectional, meaning that the sending and return
traffic paths are asymmetric in which they used different LSPs.

There are two ways to set up an LSP: via **hop-by-hop routing** or **explicit
routing**. In hop-by-hop routing, each [Label Switching Router (LSR)](202305032302.md),
supports any available [Routing Protocol](202207061815.md), independently
selects the next hop for a given FEC. In explicit routing, the ingress
[Label Edge Router (LER)](202305032259.md) specifies the list of nodes through
which the packet traverses. [Traffic Engineering](202305040730.md) provides
methods for setting up explicit routed paths.
