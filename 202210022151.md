# Authenticity

Authenticity is a quality of how true or authentic the entity is the one as
claimed. There are several threats to Authenticity such as *physical access to
authenticated device*, *impersonation of authenticated device* by masking its
[Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md)
([Masquerade](202209262114.md)), and *gaining entrance to server or disrupting
operations* with [Replay Attack](202209262121.md). This could be avoid with
cryptographic techniques.

Authentication can be done with *a shared secret*, *physical identification*
(smart card), *measurable attribute* (biometrics, thumbprint, facial
recognition), or other implicit factor (physical or logical location)
