# Implicit Quantification

$P(x)$ can be said to implicitly quantify the [202207121344](202207121344.md)# $Q(x)$, denoted as $P(x) \Rightarrow Q(x)$ or $\forall x, P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)$, if every element in the [truth set](202205061151.md)# of $P(x)$ is in the truth set of $Q(x)$.

$P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ can be said are identical to each other, denoted as $P(x) \Leftrightarrow Q(x)$ or $\forall x, P(x) \leftrightarrow Q(x)$, if their truth sets are identical.
