# Counting Numbers in Dutch

Numbers (cijfers or nummer) counted from 0 to 10 (van nul naar tien) in Dutch is
shown below:

| Cijfer | Number |
| ---    | ---    |
| nul    | zero   |
| een    | one    |
| twee   | two    |
| drie   | three  |
| vier   | four   |
| vijf   | five   |
| zes    | six    |
| zeven  | seven  |
| acht   | eight  |
| negen  | nine   |
| tien   | ten    |

Now counting from 11 to 20 (van elf tot negentien) in Dutch:

| Cijfer    | Number    |
| ---       | ---       |
| elf       | eleven    |
| twaalf    | twelve    |
| dertien   | thirteen  |
| veertien  | fourteen  |
| vijftien  | fifteen   |
| zestien   | sixteen   |
| zeventien | seventeen |
| achttien  | eighteen  |
| negentien | nineteen  |

Counting tenth in Dutch can be done by adding postfix -ig (sounds like "ug"),
starting from 20 to 90:

| Cijfer   | Number  |
| ---      | ---     |
| twintig  | twenty  |
| dertig   | thirty  |
| veertig  | forty   |
| vijftig  | fifty   |
| zestig   | sixty   |
| zeventig | seventy |
| tachtig  | eighty  |
| negentig | ninety  |

Now we comes to the hundrend, thousand, and million:


| Cijfer  | Number   |
| ---     | ---      |
| honderd | hundrend |
| duizend | thousand |
| miljoen | million  |

When pronouncing numbers like "32", we count from one instead of tenth unlike in
English. Therefore, in Dutch, "32" should be pronounced as "tweeendertig"
(similar to German) as in "twee-en-dertig" (two and thirty) instead of
"dertigtwee".
