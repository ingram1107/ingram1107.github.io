# Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol

ARQ protocol is a kind of [Protocol](202209302229.md) which provides reliable
data transmission service in addition of retransmission in case of data
corruption with positive acknowledgement (ACK) and negative acknowledgement
(NAK). ACK is used to confirmed that a packet is received in unaltered form,
otherwise an NAK will be sent. It provides services like error detection,
receiver feedback (ACK and NAK), and retransmission.

**Note**: The NAK can be implemented as duplicated ACKs.

Since retransmission is needed in case that the receiver doesn't create ACK as
it doesn't receive the packet, a timeout value should be arbitrary chosen in the
assumption that the packet loss is likely, but not guarantee, to have happened.
Sequence number is introduced in case of packet duplication due to untimely
arrived packets.

Examples of ARQ protocol are:
