# Big Data

Big data has the characteristics of large volume, great velocity (growing amount
of data), and great variety (different format of data). They are usually stored
on multiple servers in [Data Centres](202210012205.md). These big data may be
organised into a dataset, made available for other external party to use or
analyse. [Fog Computing](202408142317.md) can be used for pre-processing and
storage to reduce bandwidth used and [Latency](202304111955.md).

There are five major storage problems with big data, which are management,
#security, redundancy, [analytics](202409100023.md), and access.
