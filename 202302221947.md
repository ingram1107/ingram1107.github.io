# Asking Questions in Dutch

Question words (vraagwoorden) are important to initiate questions (vragen) in
[Dutch](202205102217.md). Those are shown in the following table with its
equivalent in English:

| Vraagwoorden | Question Word |
| ---          | ---           |
| Wat          | What          |
| Waar         | Where         |
| Hoe          | How           |
| Hoeveel      | How many/much |
| Wanneer      | When          |
| Waarom       | Why           |
| Welk/Welke   | Which         |
| Wie          | Who           |

If the [conversation](202205102252.md) take too long, we can ask "Hoe laat is
heet?" which mean literally "How late is it?". It has the semantic meaning as
English speaker says "What time is it?".
