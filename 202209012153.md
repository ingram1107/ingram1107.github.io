# Symmetric Cryptography

Symmetric Cryptography, or Private-Key Cryptography is a
#[Cryptographic](202209281121.md) system that uses the *same key* for encryption
and decryption. However, you can already imagine the security risk of sharing
the same secret over a network, requiring a *secure channel* (usually via
[IPsec](202210052208.md)#). If the key get [compromised](202209281156.md)#, it
means the need to generate a new key and [distribute](202210062203.md)# it again.
It also requires a strong encryption #algorithm for the
[intruder](202209281128.md) to not be able to guess the secret key easily. That
being said, it is quite fast when comparing to [Asymmetric Cryptography](202203221212.md).

Since both parties are equal, that is both could do encryption and encryption,
the receiver could [forge](202210022159.md)# a message and claim it to be sent
by the sender.

Its functions could be expressed in #math formulas:

$$
\begin{align}
  C &= E_K (P) \text{ or } C &= E(K, P) \\
  P &= D_K (C) \text{ or } P &= D(K, C)
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $P$ represents the plaintext
- $C$ represents the ciphertext
- $K$ represents the secret key used
- $E$ represents the encryption algorithm, and
- $D$ represents the decryption algorithm.

Example of Symmetric Cryptography:
- [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)#
- [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)#
- [Double Data Encryption Standard (2DES)](202210052316.md)#
- [Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)](202209012209.md)#
- [Kerberos](202202190818.md)#
