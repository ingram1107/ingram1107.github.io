# volatile

`volatile` is a keyword that hint on C or C++ compliers that the declared
variable should not be [optimised](202302121739.md) since it could it changed
during runtime. It can be handy when there is a need of:
- hardware interaction such as driver, microcontroller etc.
- memory mapped files
- avoiding memory address being optimised for other purposes
- #multithreading
