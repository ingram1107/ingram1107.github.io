# Digital Signature Security Notion

All possible **adversarial capabilities** or attack models of a
[Cryptanalyst](202209281128.md) on [Digital Signature](202210040909.md) are:
- Key only attack (only know the public key)
- Known message attack (access to one or more message-signature pairs)
- Chosen message attack (select messages and obtain corresponding signatures)

All **adversarial goals** of a Cryptanalyst are:
- Total break (get hold of the private key)
- Selective forgery (create a valid signature on a message chosen by someone
  else)
- Existential forgery (create a valid signature for at least one message)

Thus, the most desirable security notion for digital signature model is
Existential Unforgeable against Chosen Message Attack (EUF-CMA).
