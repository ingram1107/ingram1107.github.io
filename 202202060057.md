# Linux File Systems

#[Linux](202204081225.md) has several file systems that are used to manage
[storage](202202041952.md)#.
- [Extended File System](202202060110.md)#
- [XFS](202202081551.md)#
- Btrfs
- [ReiserFS](202202251417.md)#
- JFS
- ZFS

For filesystem repair, the command `fsck` can be used to call the appropriate
utility for the corresponding tool to the filesystem. By default, `fsck` will
assume the underlying filesystem is of `ext` filesystem (by calling `e2fsck`).
Commonly used options for `fsck` included `-A` (fix all filesystem specified in
`/etc/fstab`), `-C` (show progress bar), `-N` (print only), and `-R` (skip
checking the root filesystem when using alongside with `-A`).
