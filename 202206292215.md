# Digital Logic Circuit

Digital Logic Circuit will output an input/output table that resembles the
[202205061151](202205061151.md)#, which instead of using $T$ and $F$, it uses 1
and 0.

Two digital logic circuits can be said are the same if they have the same
input/output table. This can be proved by their corresponding
[202206292207](202206292207.md)# to see whether they are [logically
equivalent](202205061231.md)#.
