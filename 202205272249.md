# Setting up a Laravel project

To have Laravel, we need to install Composer, PHP package manager into our
machine. Then, install Laravel globally with `composer global require
laravel/installer`. The binary for it should reside in either
`$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/composer/vendor/bin/`, which
you should add it to the environment `PATH`.

As the binary is ready in use, create a Laravel project with the command
`laravel new {project-name}`. This will create a directory structure. If there
is a need for authentication, you could install the package `laravel/ui` for
`ui:auth` locally (to the project) with `composer require laravel/ui`. Upon the
project creation, it will provide an executable PHP script `artisan`. To
activate the module `ui:auth`, you need to run `php artisan ui:auth`.

Now, we can set up the project by running `npm install && npm run dev` to
install various JavaScript dependencies (this requires NodeJS and NPM).
Furthermore, create a file name `database.{db-extention}` inside the directory
`database` according to the database you are going to use. Remember to check you
have the required PHP module(s) for the database, and it has been activated in
`/etc/php/php.ini`.
