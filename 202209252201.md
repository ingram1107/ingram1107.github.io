# Terraform State

Terraform State is a metadata used by #[HashiCorp Terraform](202205041220.md) to
track the status of the real world infrastructure. It is usually stored as a
JSON file with the file name `terraform.tfstate`. Every time we hit `terraform
plan` or `terraform apply`, we'll refresh the state. In order to not do so, we
can perform `terraform plan --refresh=false` so that Terraform will deploy the
server referring to the file `terraform.tfstate` and do not refresh it.

It is advised to let everyone having the *latest state* of the Terraform State
(the file `terraform.tfstate` should be the latest), no *simultaneous access* to
Terraform operations especially those that can change state and *be private*.
One solution to this is to store the state remotely, such as in
[AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)](202312132008.md), Google Cloud Service,
HashiCorp Consul and Terraform Cloud.
