# yield

`yield` is a keyword in Python that when used in a function, will return a
[202206081814](202206081814.md)# where no code will be run. Each time when the caller extract
an object from the generator, it will proceed to the remaining code of the
callee until meet the next `yield` statement or the end of the function.

The following example shows how it works:

```python
def custom_generator():
  for i in range(3):
    yield i * i   # Everytime the interpreter met the yield statement, it will
                  # pause the execution sequence and return the generator object

my_generator = custom_generator()
for i in my_generator:
  print(i)        # This will print 0, 1, 4 consequently
```

It is commonly used in #[context manager](202206071327.md).
