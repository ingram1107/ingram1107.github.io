# Iterator

Iterator in #[STL](202202241717.md) could be used to iterate through
[container](202202241719.md) or structures. They do not own the object that they
refer.

There are 5 categories of them which could be verified by
[traits](202204181611.md)# :
- output iterator (move forward only and write only)
- input iterator (move forward only and read only)
- forward iterator (combination of output and input iterator)
- bidirectional iterator, where the iterator could move forward and backward
- random access iterator

## Multi-pass and Single-pass

The Iterators can be grouped into 2 groups based on their behaviour:
**Multi-pass Iterator** and **Single-pass Iterator**.

Multi-pass Iterator could be iterated more than one time and its content will
not be altered when wrote or read (using dereference). The example of such are
**forward iterator**, **bidirectional iterator** and **random access iterator**.
Most *sequence* [container](202202241719.md) support this.

Single-pass Iterator's content or value will be changed upon write, read or
iterated. The example of such are **output iterator** and **input iterator**.
This is usually seen when using with file streams, socket or raw devices.

## Iteration

The Iteration is done by using a pair of iterators: `first` and `last`. `first`
refer to the first element included in the sequence. `last` refer to the
non-dereferenceable position excluded from the sequence.
