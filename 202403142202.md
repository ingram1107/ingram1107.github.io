# Single Data Rate SDRAM (SDR SDRAM)

SDR [SDRAM](202403142052.md) is a synchronous RAM where the memory cells and
data transfer rate (on bus) are identical. Because of its limited factor,
increasing its throughput will increase cost, and increasing its frequency will
increase system instability unless the voltage is increase too.
