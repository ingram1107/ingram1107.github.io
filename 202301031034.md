# Intrusion Detection

There are two types of Intrusion Detection:
- [Statistical Anomaly Detection](202301031041.md)#
- [Rule-based Detection](202301031044.md)#

If an [intrusion](202301021642.md) could be detected quickly, they could be
ousted even before any damage could be done to the system. Furthermore, an
effective Intrusion Detection mechanism could be acted as a deterrent to avoid
future intrusion attempts. The collected information about the intrusion
techniques by the detection system will be useful on building on the intrusion
prevention facility.
