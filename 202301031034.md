# Intrusion Detection

There are two types of Intrusion Detection:
- [Statistical Anomaly Detection](202301031041.md)#
- [Rule-based Detection](202301031044.md)#

If an [intrusion](202301021642.md) could be detected quickly, they could be
ousted even before any damage could be done to the system. Furthermore, an
effective Intrusion Detection mechanism could be acted as a deterrent to avoid
future intrusion attempts. The collected information about the intrusion
techniques by the detection system will be useful on building on the intrusion
prevention facility.

The intrusion detection mechanism can be deployed on [Router](202207061800.md),
host (end devices like laptop and computer), or appliances in the network.

Examples of intrusion detection are:
- [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](202303081739.md)
- [Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)](202303081744.md)
