# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

TCP is a commonly used [Protocol](202209302229.md)# in
#[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md) defined by RFC793. It is a
#[Transport Layer](202206131837.md) protocol according to the classification of
#[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md). It provides
reliable data transfer, flow control (so that one channel doesn't overflow
the other), and congestion control. In addition, it also provides byte-stream
abstraction where there is no need to know how the byte stream will reach to the
destination.

TCP is designed to be *connection-oriented* and *reliable*, in contrast to
[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md). This means that connection must
be established first (using **three-way handshake**) via a full-duplex channel
and maintained by the protocol during a transmission. The requester will first
send out a control bit SYN (stand for synchronisation) and its Initial Sequence
Number (ISN) to the server. The server sends back a packet to the requester that
contains the control bit ACK (stand for acknowledgement) and its ISN. From now
on, the requester will assume the connection is well established, and it will
send packets to the server with incremented SYN and ACK (same to the server).
This way, TCP can guarantee the eventual orderly delivery of the packets.

It breaks messages into **segments** (its [Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)#)
and reassemble at the destination. If there is a failure on sending such
messages, TCP will resend it. It also provides virtual circuits between
application. At the end, the connection will be torn down if there is no need
for it.

To improve the performance, the overhead of the connection tunnel must be
addressed. This could be done by **windowing**, a method where the device sends
ACK only when it has received enough packets. The consensus about the size of
window can be reached after the server send back an ACK packet with the
information of the window size that it can achieve (usually after a packet has
failed to be sent to the server). Furthermore, it has an additional benefit of
handling the edge case where the sender could send too much, too fast which
could overflow the receiver's buffer.

When facing [Network Congestion](202209302043.md), there is a throttling
mechanism that limit the transmission rate to save bandwidth. It is one of the
reason real time communication always perform badly in TCP especially when there
is not enough bandwidth available.

Examples of TCP:
- [Diameter](202210221333.md)#
- [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)](202302251327.md)
- Telnet
- [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md)
- [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](202210221515.md)
- [Network File System (NFS)](202302131659.md)
