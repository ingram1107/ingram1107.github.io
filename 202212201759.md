# Code Word Polynomial

A #[Cyclic Code](202212192231.md) can be transformed into a Code Word Polynomial
with the following equation:

$$
\begin{align}
x &= (x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1})\\
x(D) &= x_0 + x_1 D + x_2 D^2 + \dots + x_{n-1} D^{n-1}
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $x$ is the code word
- $x_n$ is $n$th position bit which could be 0 or 1
- $D$ is an arbitrary real variable

For example, if $x = 10110$, we can transform it into polynomial $x(D) = 1 + D^2 + D^3$.
As we can see, if $D^n$ exists, this means that there is a bit on the $n$th
position.

**Note**: Addition in binary code is done with XOR and multiplication is done
with AND.
