# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is an [ANN learning method](202309091335.md) that features a
teacher and reference answer for comparison on the answer and the immediate
output generated from every input pattern. Upon encountering an error, network
parameters will be changed in order to improve the performance.

Examples of supervised learning are:
- Stochastic
- Error Correction Gradient Descent (could be least mean square or back
  propagation)
