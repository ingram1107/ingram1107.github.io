# Successful System Integration Strategies

To have a successful [System Integration (SI)](202303242149.md), we have to
employ some strategies including **strict control of overhead**, **increased
knowledge of client business**, and **proactive management to control costs and
increase market share**. Example of overhead is non-labour costs. Reducing and
controlling such overhead to run a lean business allow us to provide the market
a product with a competitive price. Furthermore, it is essential to know and
understand the client domain and markets in order to have intimate or deep
insight on the client's business and needs for technology and information
processing. The company can't be the jack of all trades, master of none.
Instead, we should be able to highlight the insufficiency and streamline it.
Last but not least, the attitude to be content to be the best in the current
field and wait for the arrival of business opportunities is no longer a valid
strategy. We have to proactively interact with the clients to sense the market
trends and retrain our personnel to acquire new skills in SI activities of all
kinds.
