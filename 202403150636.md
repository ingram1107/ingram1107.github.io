# Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM)

The first generation DDR (DDR1) SDRAM outputs the data on the rising and falling
edge of the voltage, sometimes called double-pumped bus. It introduces I/O
buffer in order to hold 2 bits per data line so that it is not require to
increase the frequency of the cell array.

DDR2 SDRAM doubles the bus frequency, thus doubles the overall data transfer
rate. For this to be economic, we assign I/O buffer 4 bits of data for each
clock cycle.

DDR3 SDRAM introduces several fundamental improvements, including the reduction
of voltage (from 1.8V to 1.5V), reduction of die size, and other electrical
advances, which all together halve the power consumption. These features made
hitting higher frequency possible for the bus, in which the I/O buffer can
handle at least 8 bits data at a time.

All DDR generation has the shortcoming on creating parallel data bus which
become ever more so as the bus frequency has been increased. It requires large
amount of data pins and has to make sure that the data and address pins are
routed so that they have the approximate same length. When DDR modules are
daisy-chained together, the signal can get more and more distorted each time a
new module is added to the motherboard.
