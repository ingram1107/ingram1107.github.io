# Dired

Dired is the default #[Emacs](202206121637.md) file explorer and manager. One can
enter it with the [command](202206131443.md)# `M-x` `dired`. It is one of the
default major modes provided by the editor. There are several default
keybindings available for us to manipulate files and directories.

| Keybind | Function                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `d`     | Mark the file or directory as to be deleted |
| `x`     | Delete all marked files and/or directories  |
| `+`     | Add new directory                           |
