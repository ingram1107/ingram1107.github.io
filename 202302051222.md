# Object Composition

Object Composition is an alternative for module [reusability](202202041514.md).
Instead of utilising [inheritance](202302042023.md), new functionalities are
obtained through assembling or composing objects. Such method often termed as
**black-box reuse**, as no internal details of objects are exposed to the
client. It is defined dynamically at runtime through objects acquiring
references to other objects. By sacrificing some performance, the object can
easily replace another object at anytime, as long as they are of the same type,
to obtain the desire behaviours when appropriate.

The Gang of Four suggested to favour Object Composition over [Class Inheritance](202302042023.md).

See [Delegation](202302051232.md) for example.
