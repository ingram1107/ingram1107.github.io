# Routing Table Principles

[Routing Table](202210112056.md)# Principles, written by Alex Zinin, stated
that:
- Every [Router](202207061800.md)# makes its decision alone, based on the
  available [Routing Table](202210112056.md)# (with [routing](202207061815.md)#
  information) that it obtained.
- It is not necessary the fact that two routers has the same routing
  information.
- Routing information about a path from one network to another doesn't provide
  routing information about the return path. (Asymmetric Routing)
