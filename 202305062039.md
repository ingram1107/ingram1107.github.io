# Return On Investment (ROI)

ROI is an expected rate of return, negative or positive, for risk comparison.
It can be calculated with the following formula:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{NPV}}{\text{total discounted costs}}
$$

Where:
- NPV is [Net Present Value (NPV)](202305061940.md)
- Total discounted costs is the sum of all discounted costs, calculated
  from multiplying the cost with the discount factor.

If ROI exceeds the required ROI set by the #organisation, the project may
proceed since it is worth investing (but factor such as [Payback Period](202305062045.md)
should be considered too). The higher the ROI, the better the investment.
