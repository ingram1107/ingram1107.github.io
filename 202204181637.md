# C++ Alternatives

The following structures are described in A Tour of C++ (second edition) as
alternatives where they could be specified to store one or set of alternatives
types. There are `variant`, `optional` and `any` imported from standard
libraries `<variant>`, `<optional>` and `<any>` respectively which are available
in C++17.

## variant

A `variant` could be defined and used as follows:

```cpp
std::variant<int, bool> x;
// ...
auto y = std::get<bool>(x);
```

From above, `x` could hold either an `int` or a `bool` value, which closely
resembles a `union` but safer. To get the value from a `variant`, we can use
`std::get` with a template parameter that specified which type should be
retrieved. The use of `variant` allows branching with `visit()` function with a
visitor.

## optional

An `optional` could be defined as follows:

```cpp
std::optional<int> x = 12; // x contains 12
std::optional<int> y = {}; // y is empty
```

It can either hold a value or be empty by initialise it as `{}`. In convention,
`optional` should be treated as a pointer to the object rather as an object.
This means that `x` as defined above should be understood as a pointer to an
`int` value which its value is 12. Additionally, `*` operator on `optional` to
get the value of the variable and the fact that `{}` or `std::nullopt` is
basically the equivalent to `nullptr` should be able to convince programmers to
treat them as so.

Accessing an `optional` that does not hold a value will result in undefined
behaviour, thus renders it as type unsafe. Furthermore, it can't take the
reference of a variable by default.

It is recommended to use `optional` in a way that encapsulate the values from
the outside world. Imagine `optional` as a box. The key design of `optional` is
to keep the value in the box and avoid peeking inside the box. This requires
function encapsulation (operation hide away by the function) and even higher
order function for advance usage. To make the optional take a reference, we
could use the function `std::reference_wrapper<T>` to wrap the reference to the
`optional` without dangerously leaving out a dangling pointer.

In [C++23](202302190651.md), `optional` has further expanded [Higher-Order Function (HOF)](202304241202.md)
such as `and_then()`, `transform()`, and `or_else()` that could be useful for
[Functional Programming](202203061121.md).

## any

An `any` could be defined and used as follows:

```cpp
std::string str = "Hello World!";
std::any message = str;
// ...
std::string recipient = std::any_cast<string>(message);
```

It could hold any type of value and be later cast by the function
`std::any_cast`. That being said, `any` can only hold one type of value
throughout its lifetime until either it is out of scope or it has called
`make_any` to allocate another `any` to itself.
