# Worm

Worm is a self-replicated [Program](202210062258.md)# that spread across network
without injecting itself into another program (unlike [Computer Virus](202211211109.md)).
The medium used are typically email or attached documents. They are usually used
to turn the victim in *zombie* to carry out [Denial of Service (DoS)](202209262115.md)#.

The lifetime of a Worm, which is pretty similar to computer virus, typically
involves four phases:
1. Dormant phase (some may not have this phase to begin with)
2. Propagation phase (spreading to other networks)
3. Triggering phase
4. Execution phase (execute the payload)

Several technologies are used to act in worm spreading:
- multiplatform across multiple #operating-system
- multiexploits (penetrating system in various ways)
- ultrafast spreading by prior scan to get victims' address
- polymorphic (to evade detection)
- metamorphic (change both appearance and behaviour pattern)
- as a transport vehicle for other attacks such as DoS zombies.
- zero-day exploit
