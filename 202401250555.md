# Amazon DynamoDB

DynamoDB provides managed [NoSQL](202302192224.md) database service similar to
[Amazon RDS](202401250532.md) where Amazon is responsible for underlying
infrastructure provisioning.

It supports two kinds of primary key, that is **partition key** (composed of
**sort key**) and **composite partition key** (partition key + sort key). QUERY
and SCAN can be done on the table to find out the item that match the filter
criteria. The difference between them is that QUERY uses primary key for the
search while SCAN is able to find the items via non-key attributes despite being
slower (scan through the whole database).
