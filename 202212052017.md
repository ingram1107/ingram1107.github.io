# Web Proxy

Web Proxy prefetches web contents, which is called #caching, to speed up the
performance or real time response of a web service and saving up bandwidth. If
its client requested web content is not found in the server, then web proxy will
pose a request to the corresponding web server in order to deliver the web
content to the client later. However, this is come with a downside, that is
there could be outdated web contents in the Web Proxy repertoire used to serve
the clients. There are several ways to improve it:
- With [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md), one can specify
  whether a document is cacheable. In addition, with 1.1 version, the expiration
  time for page can be specified by the author with conditional `GET` (explained
  below).
- Configure the maximum interval a page can stay in the web proxy without
  expired.
- Refresh using web browser as it keeps caches too.

With conditional `GET`, the web proxy sends a `GET` message with
`If-modified-since` header where its value is the same to the stored HTML
response's `Last-modified` value to the server upon a request by the client. If
the server response with `304 Not Modified`, the web proxy knows that the
content remains unchanged and fetched the stored HTML contents to the client.
