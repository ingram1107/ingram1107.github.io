# Web Proxy

Web Proxy prefetches web contents to speed up the performance or real time
response of the web service. If its client requested web content is not found in
the server, then web proxy will pose a request to the corresponding web server
in order to deliver the web content to the client later. However, this is come
with a downside, that is there could be outdated web contents in the Web Proxy
repertoire used to serve the clients.
