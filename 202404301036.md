# Ring Buffer

Ring buffer, aka circular [Queue](202112101836.md), is a fixed-size special data
structure where the data are loaded at the tail and read from the head. It is
similar to FIFO [List](202110191710.md). Simultaneous read from and write to the
buffer can be achieved without overflowing it by testing the condition. Usually,
ring buffer is deployed to control multiple requests for a single resource such
as memory blocks, modems, printers etc.
