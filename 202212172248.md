# Linear Cryptanalysis

Linear Cryptanalysis is an #[Analytic Attacks](202212172229.md) approximate the
non-linearity with linear equations (finding the linear approximation). This is
focus on the [S-boxes](202209281136.md)' non-linearity.

The mechanic works by approximating S-boxes by linear functions, then iterate
over rounds with decreasing probabilities.

It could be used to attack [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
with $2^{43}$ known plaintexts.
