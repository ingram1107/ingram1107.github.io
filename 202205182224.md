# X Display Manager (XDM)

XDM is a #[202205182153](202205182153.md) available in [202204081225](202204081225.md). All configuration
files can be found in the directory `/etc/X11/xdm`. `xdm-config` is the main
configuration file where the variable `DisplayManager.requestPort` could be set
to 0 to disable remote access or 177 which is the port to listen for connection.
The file `Xaccess` is used to restrict the access to the #[202205182136](202205182136.md)
server. The following shows the example:

```
*.social.linux.pizza
littleclover.com
*.social.linux.pizza CHOOSER BROADCAST
```

The example configuration above indicates that the domain `social.linux.pizza`
can connect to the XDM and request a chooser (a display of local systems that
accept #[202205182136](202205182136.md)). `littleclover.com` otherwise can only connect to the
XDM.

To set environment variable for #[202205051624](202205051624.md) specifically, one could put
them into the file `Xresources`.

If there is an error upon remote connection to the client, try to find a line of
command in the configuration files that contains `-nolisten tcp` and remove it.
