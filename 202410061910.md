# Sed Regexp

`sed` allows [Regular Expression](202410061901.md) with the use of two `/` where
characters within are recognised as pattern policy for regular expression. The
most commonly used command is `s/{regex}/{replacement}/` to replace the match
regexp. Other commands can be used such as `c` (to replace selected lines with
text), `a` (append), and `r` (append from specified file).
