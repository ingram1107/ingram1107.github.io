# Cipher Feedback (CFB)

CFB is the most common [stream mode of operation](202209281239.md)# defined in
#[Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md) and #[Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)
where preceding ciphertext is used as input to the encryption #algorithm to
produce pseudorandom output. The output will then be XORed ($\oplus$) with
plaintext to produce the next unit of ciphertext. The input is processed $s$
bits at a time. This process is almost identical to the decryption side of end
with the same encryption mode.

The standard defined allows any number of bits to be feed back which is denoted
CFB-1, CFB-8, CFB-64, CFB-128 etc. Though it is more efficient to use all the
bits in block, so CFB-64 and CFB-128 will come in handy.

The encryption scheme is shown as below:

$$
\begin{align}
C_i &= p_i \oplus \text{ des}_{k1} (c_{i-1})\\
C_{-1} &= iv
\end{align}
$$

Where:
- $C$ is the ciphertexst
- $p$ is the plaintext
- $\text{des}$ is the [Data Encryption Standard (DES)](202209012203.md)
  algorithm
- $k$ is the subkey
- $iv$ is the [initialisation vector](202210071133.md)#

However, CFB is not without downside. It needs to stall while do block
encryption after every $n$-bits.

The typical usages of CFB are for general-purpose stream-oriented transmission
and authentication.
