# Interprocess Communication (IPC)

IPC is an operating system facility that allows processes within a system or
from different system to communicate (exchange information and synchronise) with
each other. It is important since it allows information sharing between
processes, [Parallelism](202202011808.md)#, modularity, and convenience.

There are several methods of IPC:
- [Pipe](202210280908.md)#
- [Named Pipe (FIFO)](202211080915.md)#
- [System V's IPC](202308162231.md)
- [POSIX IPC](202308162223.md)
- [Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)](202302161128.md)
- [Unix Domain Socket](202303232001.md)

For the latter three methods (message queues, semaphore and shared memory), the
kernel will create an object called IPC object which stores its information. The
following codes show an example for an IPC object named as `ipc_perm`:

```c
struct ipc_perm {
  uid_t uid;    // owner's user id
  gid_t gid;    // owner's group id
  uid_t cuid;   // creater's user id
  gid_t cgid;   // creater's group id
  mode_t mode;  // permissions
  ulong_t seq;  // slot usage sequence number
  key_t key;    // IPC key associated with the object
};
```

**Note**: See [IPC Facilities Key](202212071232.md)#.

The `set` slot usage sequence number is a system-wide counter maintained by
kernel for every potential IPC object in the system. It is increase upon
removal, 0 when it is overflowed. By incrementing identifier value that is
returned to the calling process, by number of IPC table entries, each time a
table entry is reused, it avoids [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md) from
rouge process to gain access to messages and short-term use of System V IPC
tables which will not be reused after termination.

These IPC objects could be checked with the command `ipcs {flags}` (abbreviated
from IPC show) comes with the flags `-m` (shared memory), `-s` (semaphore) and
`-q` (message queue), and be removed by `ipcrm {obj} {id}` (abbreviated from IPC
remove) with `msg` (message queue), `sem` (semaphore) and `shm` (shared memory).

Based on the information persistency, we could also categorise IPC into the
following three types:
- [Process-Persistent IPC](202307131641.md)
- [Kernel-Persistent IPC](202307131645.md)
- [Filesystem-Persistent IPC](202307131657.md)
