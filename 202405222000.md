# Exception

Exception can be any event that disrupts the normal execution of the processor
and force it into privilege state to execute special instructions. It can be
categorised into two types: [Synchronous Exception](202405222002.md) and
[Asynchronous Exception](202405222010.md).

Regardless of on how it is raised, exceptions are used to handle and recover
from error conditions. It ensures that external hardware devices can perform
device-specific operations in parallel to the processor with minimal
intervention from the latter. It also provides a communication mechanism between
the device and the processor for service request.

When an exception is triggered, current processor state information is saved.
Then, the exception handling function is loaded into the program counter and
then the control is transferred to the handler function for execution. Once the
handler function finishes its job, the processor state information is restored,
and it resumes previous execution.
