# Wireless LAN (WLAN)

Wireless LAN is defined by the standard IEEE 802.11, including 802.11a, 802.11b,
802.11g, and 802.11n, also known as Wireless Ethernet or Wi-Fi. It utilies
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSS) for wireless [Multiplexing](202209091259.md).
802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n are compatible standards that can use up to 14
overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz band, in which 1, 6, and 11 are
non-overlapping. 802.11a is, however, incompatible to the mentioned standards as
it uses 12 non-overlapping channels for indoor use in the 5 GHz band, and allows
additional channels designed for outdoor use.

WLAN can be secured by [802.1x/EAP-FAST authentication](202303021603.md) and
[WPA2](202303021606.md) encryption. For securing against
[Intruder](202301021642.md), [Intrusion Detection System (IDS)](202303081739.md)
can be used.
