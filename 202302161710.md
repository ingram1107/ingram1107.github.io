# Wireless LAN (WLAN)

Wireless LAN is a [wireless network](202303301607.md) which cover a small area
up to 10 100 meters. It utilises [radio waves](202302161842.md) or radio
carriers to deliver energy to a remote receiver with
[modulation](202304061543.md). It can be categorised into two types:
[Infrared WLAN](202304061144.md) and [Spread Spectrum WLAN](202304061156.md).
Mostly likely, WLAN doesn't utilise [CSMA/CD](202207051755.md) since the node
can't differentiate corrupted signal from healthy one due to channel impairments
in the vicinity of the receiving node, thus render collision detection
infeasible.

WLAN configuration typically consists of [access point (AP)](202304061549.md)
and end user adapters (WLAN adapters, ISA/PCI adapters, full integrated
devices).
