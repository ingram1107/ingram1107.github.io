# Screened Host Firewall System with Duo-Homed Bastion Host

This [Screened Host Firewall System](202302131829.md) is an enhancement to
[Screened Host Firewall System with Single-Homed Bastion Host](202302131830.md).
It addresses the issue when the [Packet-Filtering Router](202301221147.md) is
being compromised. Now, the traffic must flow through the [Bastion Host](202301221214.md)
instead.
