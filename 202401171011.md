# Message Queuing Architecture

Message queuing architecture utilises [message queue](202212071258.md) to
establish communication between applications, categorised as [producers and consumers](202201301240.md),
by sending and reading messages in the queue. The messages are queued
asynchronously between the applications and systems.
