# Radio LAN

The bandwidth for Radio LAN is between 9 kHz and 300 GHz. The main three
topologies for radio LAN are:
- Peer-to-Peer (maximum size of LAN is the area which encompasses the radio of
  the maximum transmission range of all the terminals)
- Base-to-Remote (transmission routed to or from the base station)
- Base-to-Remote with [wired LAN](202207051554.md) (base station as
  [Bridge](202207051851.md) between radio LAN and wired LAN)

However, there are weaknesses of using radio LAN, primarily the concerns on
collocated (parallel) but unrelated radio LANs and [multipath](202305101932.md) effects. The first
issue describes the possibility of interferences between multiple unrelated and
independently operated LANs, especially those with similar frequencies, in the
same area. The second issue will happen if extremely high frequencies are used
for radio LAN. In such case, the radio wave will reflect off solid objects which
create multiple paths to reach the receiver from the transmitter, which is a
major concern in indoor environments.

To solve the first issue, we have to allow channel sharing and other LAN
administration. Fortunately, the use of [spread spectrum technology](202304061156.md)
ensures that radio LANs may coexist. For the second issue, there are several
countermeasures such as multiple directional antennas, multiple antennas,
multiple coordinated receivers, polarisation diversity, limiting data rate,
spread spectrum techniques, frequency diversity, adaptive equalisation etc.
