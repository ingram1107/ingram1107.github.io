# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

ANN works like a typical human [Neural Network](202309091307.md), but by using
[mathematical or computational model](202309091345.md) and arranged in layers
instead of using chemical chains of reactions. The connection pattern of an ANN
could be either [feed-forward](202309091359.md) or [recurrent](202309091404.md).

Based on learning methods, ANN could be categorised into:
- [Supervised Learning](202309091545.md)
- [Unsupervised Learning](202309091548.md)
- [Reinforced Learning](202309091551.md)

ANN could be applied on time series prediction like weather forecast, adaptive
filters, stock market etc., process or machine control, bankruptcy or fraud
prediction, checkers players, and topological map such as brain, metrological
profiles. In [Bioinformatics](202308152050.md), we could use it for
[protein secondary structure prediction](202308082207.md),
[Gene](202308091142.md) identification, protein-protein or gene-gene
interaction, and DNA binding site recognition.
