# Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

Come up with a hypothesis. For example, $A' = A$. Ask "If $A' = A$, what is the
probability of measuring a speed-up between two programs by chance". And then
examine whether the hypothesis is true for two normal distribution or Student's
t distribution. If the possibility is larger than 5%, then hypothesis $A' = A$
is true, and the speed-up is **insignificance**. Otherwise, reject the
hypothesis and conclude that the speed-up is significance.
