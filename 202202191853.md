# Deadlocks

Deadlocks happen when there are multiple process or threads waiting for each
other to relinquish the control of the needed resources. It often appears as a
**circular list**. There are four conditions for deadlock: *mutual exclusion*
(resources that can't be shared), *circular wait*, *hold and wait*, and *no
pre-emption*.

There are several ways trying to avoid deadlock from happening. We could use
watchdog timers or real-time debuggers for that. In the case of
[Semaphore](202404302127.md), assign a time-out to it. Minimise the number of
critical regions and their length and don't suspend the task that controls a
critical region. Note that all critical region must be error-free. Obligatory
validity checks on pointers within critical regions. The lock must be released
as soon as the task has done its job, and don't lock any devices in interrupt
handlers.

Drastic measures such as system resetting or rollback to pre-deadlock state
could also be considered. Some would even choose to ignore deadlocks altogether,
however it is a bad software practice.
