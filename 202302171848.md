# Data-Definition Language (DDL)

DDL defines the schema of a [Database](202302101139.md) where its output is
stored into data dictionary (access by the database) which contains the metadata
about the database structure. Several consistency constraints may be imposed on
the variable defines in DDL such as *domain constraints* (the data types of the
value), *referential integrity* (ensure that a value that appears in one
relation for a given set of attributes also appears in a certain set of
attributes in another relation), *assertions*, and
[Authorisation](202210221159.md).
