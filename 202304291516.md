# Norman's Theory of Action

Norman (1986) proposed the Theory of Action, which includes the following 7
stages of an activity:
1. Establish a goal (finding out breaking news)
2. Form an intention (check out BBC)
3. Specify an action sequence (move cursor to the BBC link on a browser)
4. Execute an action (click on the mouse button)
5. Perceive the system state (see a new page loaded)
6. Interpret the state (read that it is the BBC website)
7. Evaluate the system state with respect to the goals and intentions (read
   breaking news)
