# System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC is a framework for describing phases involved in developing and maintaining
information systems. It can follow either [Predictive Life Cycle Model](202303251031.md)
or [Adaptive Life Cycle Model](202303251036.md). Generally, it involves the
following phases:
1. Initialisation phase (identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives)
2. [Requirement](202303251303.md) phase
3. Analysis phase (system needs)
4. Design phase
5. Development and [Documentation](202202241058.md) phase
6. Testing and maintenance phase
7. Deployment and evaluation phase
