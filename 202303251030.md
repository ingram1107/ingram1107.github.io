# System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

SDLC is a framework for describing phases involved in developing and maintaining
information systems. It can follow either [Predictive Life Cycle Model](202303251031.md)
or [Adaptive Life Cycle Model](202303251036.md). Generally, it involves the
following phases:
1. Initialisation phase (identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives)
2. [Requirement](202303251303.md) phase
3. Analysis phase (system needs)
4. Design phase (finalise [System Architecture](202303242154.md), prepare
   [system design specification](202304211926.md), obtain user approval, present
   to management)
5. Development and #documentation phase
6. Testing and maintenance phase
7. Deployment and evaluation phase
