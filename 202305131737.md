# eNodeB

eNodeB contains the radio and antenna tools to connect the user equipment (UE)
and the [Long-Term Evolution (LTE)](202304111948.md) core network by the radio
frequency air line. It is similar to the base transceiver station (BTS) in
[GSM](202304111937.md) and the NodeB in [UMTS](202304111944.md), with being more
functionally robust in LTE.
