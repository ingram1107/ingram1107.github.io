# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

To find $GCD(a, b)$, one could use [Euclidean Algorithm](202210092226.md)# using
the theorem $GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a \mod b); a > b$ to find the largest
#[Divisor](202210092143.md) that could divide both $a$ and $b$. If the GCD
between the two numbers is 1, then we could say that $a$ and $b$ are *relatively
prime* to each other and a [multiplicative inverse](202210082303.md)# could be
found. There are several rules to know:

$$
\begin{align}
GCD(a, 0) &= a\\
GCD(a, 1) &= 1\\
\end{align}
$$
