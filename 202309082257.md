# Sarawak Politics

The demography of Sarawak consists of 44.3% Dayak, 26.5% Chinese, 23.2% Malay,
Melanau 5.7%, and Indian 0.2%. In 1963, National Party of Sarawak (Parti Negara
Sarawak, PANAS), Sarawak Native People's Front (BARJASA), Sarawak Native's
Heritage Party (Parti Pesaka Anak Sarawak, PESAKA), and Sarawak Chinese
Association (SCA) formed Sarawak Alliance Party (Parti Perikatan Sarawak). PANAS
and BARJASA both represents the interests of Melanau and Malay, whereas PESAKA
represents Dayak's interests. Three of them later merged into a single party
called Sarawak United Bumiputera Heritage Party (Parti Pesaka Bersatu Sarawak,
PBB). SCA mainly represents Fujian and Teochew people's interest. However, the
latter was utterly defeated in 1963 election by Sarawak United People's Party
(SUPP) and ultimately disbanded in 1974. SUPP remained opposition from 1963
until 1970, which then it joined the Alliance Party in the Peninsular.

Democratic Action Party (DAP) contests in Sarawak since 1974 and gained
significant result in 2006 among Chinese voters. Another important opposition
party is Sarawak National Party (Parti Kebangsaan Sarawak, SNAP), established in
1963, joined with the Alliance Party in the Peninsular, exit in 1966 due to
constitutional crisis, rejoined again in 1976, but then finally exit from it in
2004. It later joined into People's Alliance (Perikatan Rakyat) as opposition in
2010. Sarawak Progressive Democratic Party (SPDP) is split from SNAP.

During the 1987 state election, Sarawak Malaysian People's Union (Persatuan
Rakyat Malaysia Sarawak, PERMAS) and Sarawak Dayak People's Party (Parti Bansa
Dayak Sarawak, PBDS) nearly defeated the 4th Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud's
PBB. However, the later power struggle between Daniel Tajem and James Jemut
Masing after the resignation of Leo Moggie as PBDS President resulted in a party
split of Sarawak People's Party (Parti Rakyat Sarawak, PRS). PRS, overshadowed
by its former self, achieved limited success in 2006 state election.
