# Performance Testing

Performance Testing is a testing to ensure the #performance requirements or
#resource utilisation of the program under run-time and real-world conditions.
It includes but not limited to *performance testing*, *stress testing*
(evaluates system limits in abnormal environment including parameters of
quantity, frequency, volume, etc. over a short period of time), and *testing
under load*. It plays an important part in #[Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md).
Performance testing is often complemented with #hardware or #software
instruments to monitor execution intervals, log events, sample machine states
regularly.

Depending on the situation, a specialised testing hardware or software might be
needed in order to mimic the real-world scenario.

Furthermore, [Regression Testing](202206201335.md)# can be applied on this kind
of testing in order to capture the discrepancy of the performance between the
previous version and the current version of the software.
