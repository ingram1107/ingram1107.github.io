# Performance Testing

Performance Testing is a testing to ensure the the performance requirements of the program under real-world conditions. It includes but not limited to *performance testing*, *stress testing* and *testing under load*. It plays an important part in #[202206201159](202206201159.md).

Depending on the situation, a specialised testing hardware or software might be needed in order to mimic the real-world scenario.

Furthermore, [202206201335](202206201335.md)# can be applied on this kind of testing in order to capture the discrepancy of the performance between the previous version and the current version of the software.
