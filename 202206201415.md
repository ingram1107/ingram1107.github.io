# Performance Testing

Performance Testing is a testing to ensure the #performance requirements of the
program under real-world conditions. It includes but not limited to *performance
testing*, *stress testing* and *testing under load*. It plays an important part
in #[Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md).

Depending on the situation, a specialised testing hardware or software might be
needed in order to mimic the real-world scenario.

Furthermore, [Regression Testing](202206201335.md)# can be applied on this kind
of testing in order to capture the discrepancy of the performance between the
previous version and the current version of the software.
