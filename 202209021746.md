# Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)

CWDM uses wavelength-specific pairs of Gigabit Interface Converters (GBIC)
connected to a [Switch](202207051907.md)# pair in order to
#[multiplex](202209091312.md) up to *8 #[Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md)
signals* onto a single fibre. Each GBIC pair is tuned to a specific frequency
that allows the switch to add (mux) or pluck out (demux) a single beam of light
(data stream). However, CWDM is unable to be amplified, which limited its
maximum distance to 80 km for point-to-point or a ring circumference of 30 km.
