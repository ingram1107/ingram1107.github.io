# Extended File System

Extended File System (ext) is one of a series of native #[linux file system](202202060057.md).
There are mainly three of the versions is still active: *ext2*, *ext3* and
*ext4*.

## [Journaling](202202061336.md)

**Note:** Only ext3 and ext4 can access this feature

To enable journaling feature on ext2, see [#Tuning](#Tuning).

## Get Information

`dumpe2fs` allow us to obtain file system information such as *turned on
file system features*, *file system state*, *inode count*, *block count*, *last
checked* and *check interval*.

It can be used when the file system is mounted.

## Maintenance

Outside the use of `fsck` for filesystem maintenance, for non-interactive user
experience, one can directly call the command `e2fsck` with the option `-p`
(non-interactive unless it requires intervention in which it exits), `-y` (all
yes), `-n` (filesystem is mounted as read-only), and `-f` (force).

## Tuning

`tune2fs` allow us to adjust the file system settings such as:
- `-j` to add a journal (effectively turning ext2 into ext3)
- `-J` to adjust journaling options such as `size`, `location`, and `device`
- `-i` to set the check interval for `fsck` in the format of `N[d/m/y]`
- `-c` to set the maximum number of times the disk may be mounted without a
  check
- `-C` to set the number of times the disk has been mounted
- `-m` and `-r` to define reserved disk space in percentage or blocks for root
- `-L` to set the device's label up to 16 characters
- `-U` to set the 128 bit hexadecimal UUID of the device
- `-e` to define the kernel behaviour upon encountering filesystem error, which
  include options like `continue` (the default behaviour), `remount-ro` (useful
  in data-sensitive applications), and `panic`

However, this must be done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent
data corruption.

## Debugging

`debugfs` allow us to debug the file system interactively. However, this must be
done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent data corruption.

There are multiple commands that could be helpful:
- `stats` to display information similar to `dumpe2fs`
- `stat` to show the inode information for a file or directory
- `lsdel` to list deleted inodes
- `undelete` to restore the file by referring to its inode number
- `write` to extract a file from the file system

We could use regular commands such as `cd`, `rm` and `touch` in the debugging
environment too.
