# Extended File System

Extended File System (ext) is one of a series of native #[202202060057](202202060057.md). There
are mainly three of the versions is still active: *ext2*, *ext3* and *ext4*.

## #[Journaling](202202061336.md)

**Note:** Only ext3 and ext4 can access this feature

To enable journaling feature on ext2, see [#Tuning](#Tuning).

## Get Information

`dumpe2fs` allow us to obtain file system information such as *turned on
file system features*, *file system state*, *inode count*, *block count*, *last
checked* and *check interval*.

It can be used when the file system is mounted.

## Tuning

`tune2fs` allow us to adjust the file system settings such as:
- `-j` to add a journal (effectively turning ext2 into ext3)
- `-i` to set the check interval for `fsck`
- `-c` to set the maximum number of times the disk may be mounted without a
  check
- `-C` to set the number of times the disk has been mounted
- `-m` and `-r` to define reserved disk space in percentage or blocks for root

However, this must be done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent
data corruption.

## Debugging

`debugfs` allow us to debug the file system interactively. However, this must be
done in an **unmounted file system** in order to prevent data corruption.

There are multiple commands that could be helpful:
- `stats` to display information similar to `dumpe2fs`
- `stat` to show the indoe information for a file or directory
- `lsdel` to list deleted inodes
- `undelete` to restore the file by referring to its inode number
- `write` to extract a file from the file system

We could use regular commands such as `cd`, `rm` and `touch` in the debugging
environment too.
