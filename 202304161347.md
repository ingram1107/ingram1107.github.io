# Vertical Application

Vertical application is a #software developed to handle information
[Requirements](202303251303.md) for a specific type of business. This is usually
a result from an in-house development which suffers from inflexibility to adapt
to different business environment. Such vertical application may satisfy unique
business and #security requirements, meet existing system's and technology's
(existing #hardware and legacy system) [constraints](202303250956.md), minimise
the changes in business procedure and policies, and develop internal resources
and capabilities (IT staff understands the business function and information
support needs).
