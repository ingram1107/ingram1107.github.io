# Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a short-range #communication technology defined by [IEEE 802.15.1](202304271819.md)
(standardising the [Physical Layer](202206131647.md) and [MAC layer](202303301623.md))
which is an industrial specification for [WPANs](202303292149.md). It uses 2.4
to 2.485 GHz band, with typical full-duplex signal rate of 1600 hops/second
using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). It is robust, low power (100
mW), and low cost comparing to other WPAN technologies. Usually, it is used as a
data [Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md), a replacement of [Metallic Cable](202210111820.md),
or ad hoc networking.

In Bluetooth, a connected radio may be a hive, a drone, or both at the same time
(but in different piconet). This form the basis for Bluetooth network topologies
stated as the following:
- [Piconet](202304220122.md)
- [Scatternet](202304220132.md)

To establish a connection, two procedures, that is **inquiry** and **paging**,
have to be carried out by the device. Devices perform inquire scans to discover
discoverable Bluetooth devices that are in range and their respective
[addresses](202304220122.md). Those intend to connect with the hive node will
respond with their device addresses and set of hop frequencies. After that, a
device that establishes the connection will carry out the paging procedure and
automatically become the hive in the piconet.

Depending on the class, the ranges can be varied. With Class 1, the Bluetooth
range can reach up to 1 m with 1 mW power. Class 2 enhances it to 10 m with 2.5
mW, which is the most common class for mobile devices. Class 3 can reach up to
100 m with 100 mW power, primarily used for industrial purposes.

As the time goes, the revision of the Bluetooth standard enhances its data rate
dramatically especially with the introduction of Enhanced Data Rate (EDR)
technology. In version 1.2, the data rate it could support is 1 Mbps. Version
2.0 with EDR, 3 Mbps is possible. Bluetooth 3 and 4 with EDR could reach up to
24 Mbps maximum data rate. The newest Bluetooth version 5 pushes this threshold
to 48 Mbps. The following table shows the evolution of Bluetooth's data rate:

| Bluetooth Version           | Maximum Transmission Rate  |
| ---                         | ---                        |
| Bluetooth 1.0a and 1.0b     | 732.2 kbps                 |
| Bluetooth 1.1               | 732.2 kbps                 |
| Bluetooth 1.2               | 1 Mbps                     |
| Bluetooth 2.0 and 2.1       | 2.1 Mbps (3 Mbps with EDR) |
| Bluetooth 3.0               | 24 Mbps                    |
| Bluetooth 4.0               | 24 Mbps                    |
| Bluetooth 4.1 and 4.2       | 25 Mbps                    |
| Bluetooth 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2 | 50 Mbps                    |

Bluetooth's protocol stack consists of lower layer protocols and upper layer
protocols. Lower layer protocols include [Bluetooth Radio](202304220913.md),
[Baseband](202304220915.md), [Link Manager Protocol (LMP)](202304220918.md), and
[Host Controller Interface (HCI)](202304220921.md). Upper layer protocols
include [Audio](202304220922.md), [Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer (L2CAP)](202304220923.md),
[Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)](202304220929.md), [Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM)](202304220932.md),
[Object Exchange (OBEX)](202304220934.md), [Telephony Control Protocol Specification Binary (TCS BIN)](202304220937.md),
[Attention Sequence (AT)](202304220941.md), and [Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)](202304220943.md).

Two link types is available for use in Bluetooth:
[Synchronous Connection-Oriented Link (SCO)](202405071016.md) and
[Asynchronous Connectionless Link (ACL)](202405071017.md).
