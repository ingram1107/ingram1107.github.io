# Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a short-range #communication technology defined by IEEE 802.15.1
(standardising the [Physical Layer](202206131647.md) and [MAC Layer](202206151451.md))
which is an industrial specification for [WPANs](202303292149.md). It is robust,
low power, and low cost comparing other WPAN technologies. Usually, it is used
as a data [Access Point (AP)](202304061549.md), a replacement of [Metallic Cable](202210111820.md),
or ad hoc networking.

In Bluetooth, a connected radio may a hive, a drone, or both at the same time
(but in different piconet). This form the basis for Bluetooth network topologies
stated as the following:
- [Piconet](202304220122.md)
- [Scatternet](202304220132.md)

Bluetooth's protocol stack consists of lower layer protocols and upper layer
protocols. Lower layer protocols include [Bluetooth Radio](202304220913.md),
[Baseband](202304220915.md), [Link Manager Protocol (LMP)](202304220918.md), and
[Host Controller Interface (HCI)](202304220921.md). Upper layer protocols
include [Audio](202304220922.md), [Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer (L2CAP)](202304220923.md),
[Service Discovery Protocol (SDP)](202304220929.md), [Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM)](202304220932.md),
[Object Exchange (OBEX)](202304220934.md), [Telephony Control Protocol Specification Binary (TCS BIN)](202304220937.md),
[Attention Sequence (AT)](202304220941.md), and [Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)](202304220943.md).
