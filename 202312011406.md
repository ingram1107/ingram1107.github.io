# AWS Region

AWS Region is a geographical area that consists of two or more *availability
zones* (each include several [Data Centres](202210012205.md)) connected by
high-bandwidth, low latency #networking. Availability zones are design with the
mind of fault isolation. Frequently accessed content are stored in edge
location, whereas those that are not frequently accessed are stored in regional
edge caches.
