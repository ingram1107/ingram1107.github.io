# Template Deduction Guide

Template Deduction Guide is used to tell the compiler that the type of the
passed parameter(s) should meet the requirement stated by the guide. It usually
used alongside with #[202204181611](202204181611.md). Its replacement will be [202203281200](202203281200.md)#
in C++20.

An example of such usage is shown below:

```cpp
template<typename Iter>
Vector(Iter, Iter) -> Vector<typename std::iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type>;
```

**Note**: The left-hand side of the statement does not mean to match to the
class constructor. It merely serves as a matching guide to the parameters.
