# Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID)

RAID is a technology that combines multiple disks into a single unit in order to
improve the redundancy and performance. It helps in load balancing of multiple
small access and parallelising large accesses.

**Note**: Non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) is usually installed on RAID
controller in order to provide a safe and fast buffer to store pending
instructions.

RAID 0 allows block-level striping in which the blocks are stripes across
multiple disks which can increase number of read accesses. RAID 1 allows only
mirroring. RAID 2 is called memory-style error-correction code organisation that
employs parity bits to do error detection and correction. RAID 3 or
bit-interleaved parity organisation employs only a single parity bit. Comparing
to RAID 2, it requires less storage, thus replacing RAID 2 in practice. RAID 4
or block-interleaved parity organisation employs parity block instead, which
compare to RAID 2 and 3, has higher overall I/O rate and large read or write
rates. RAID 5 employs block-interleaved distribute parity in which the data and
parity is partitioned among all $N + 1$ disks, which offers better performance
than RAID 4. RAID 6 employs P + Q redundancy scheme, which is similar to RAID 5,
in addition of extra redundant information to guard against multiple disk
failure. It also uses error-correction codes such as Reed-Solomon code.
