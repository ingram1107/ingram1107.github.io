# Awareness, Training, and Eduction (AT&E)

AT&E is an iterative process where employees are required to update their
[Information Assurance](202408141942.md) knowledge constantly because of changes
to their positions, [duties](202408262322.md), and the overall threat/risk
environment. For it to be successful, AT&E should be tailored to specific groups
to meet organisational security goals and achieve specific results. Always grant
employees minimal access required to the information system for them to be able
to perform their duties in order to minimise risks.
