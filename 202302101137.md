# Database-Management System (DBMS)

DBMS is [a collection of interrelated data](202302101139.md) and a set of
programs to access and modifty those data. It aims to provide a convenient and
efficient way to store and retrieve database information. One of the purpose of
DBMS is [data abstraction](202302101203.md), that is the details on data storage
and maintenance are hidden. It addresses several limitations from
file-processing system such as *[data redundancy and inconsistency](202206171004.md)*
(leads to higher storage and access cost), *difficulty in accessing data*, *data
isolation* (files could be in different formats), *[integrity problems](202210040913.md)*,
*atomicity problems* (doesn't result in inconsistent state), *concurrent-access
anomalies*, and *security problems* (have no [Access Control](202210022203.md)).
An effective DBMS should ensure operation atomicity, data consistency (after
operation), and data durability (due to system failure).

DBMS provides two methods to access and/or manipulate the
[Database](202302101139.md): [Data-Definition Language (DDL)](202302171848.md)
and [Data-Manipulation Language (DML)](202302171843.md). The components that
involve in processing the request are [storage manager](202302171908.md),
[query processor](202302171911.md), and query evaluation engine.
