# Android Application Framework

Android application framework layer provides many higher-level services to
application in the form of Java classes where the developers could make use of.
It includes **Activities** (controls all aspects to publish and share data with
other applications), **Content Providers** (allows application to publish and
share data with other applications), **Resource Manager** (provide access to
non-code embedded resources such as strings, colour settings, and user interface
layouts), **Notifications Manager** (allows applications to display alerts and
notifications to the user), and **View System** (an extensible set of views used
to create application user interfaces).
