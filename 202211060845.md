# Default Route

Default Route is a route that will match all packets when the packet's
destination [IP Address](202206281021.md)# is not known. It reduces the size of
the [Routing Table](202210112056.md)#. Typically, Default Route is used to
connect edge [Router](202207061800.md)# to [Internet Service Provider's (ISP)](202209271141.md)#
network.

To define a Default Route in [Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md)#,
use the command `ip route` and assign two [quad zeros](202206151453.md)# (0.0.0.0) to
it with an interface's IP address or name.
