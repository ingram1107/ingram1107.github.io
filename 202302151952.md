# von Neumann Architecture

von Neumann Architecture is a computer architecture proposed by John von Neumann
in which the programs and data are stored in the same memory. The instructions
and data are need to be fetched to the central processing unit (CPU), consists of
control unit (CU) and arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), from the memory. The
result of the computation will in turn stored in the memory. Since that CPU
always has a faster execution speed that the transmit rate of the data from
memory to CPU, it renders the CPU to be underutilised. Such phenomenon is called
**von Neumann bottleneck**.
