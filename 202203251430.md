# Docker Registry

#[Docker](202110201636.md) Registry is a central repository for images just like GitHub.
You could run `docker push` or `docker pull` to put or get the images from
specified repository. By default, the images are push or pull from Docker Hub
(docker.io).

You could log in to a registry, either public or private, using the command
`docker login {registry}`.

## Private Registry Deployment

Run `registry` image from `docker run`. Remember the port mapping in
[Docker Networking](202203171238.md)# in order to access the registry from Docker host or external
clients.

Name your [Docker Image](202202211632.md) with `tag` command and `push` it to the registry.
