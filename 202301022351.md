# Password Selection Guide

Generally, a long password (at least 20 alphanumeric characters) should be safe
from [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md)# as its strength is guided by its
bits of [Entropy](202209291005.md)#.

Several strategies could be used to guide the user to select a good password:
- User education by telling the importance of a good password and providing a
  guideline
- Computer-generated passwords particularly from password manager
- Reactive password checking where the system cracks the password by itself
  periodically, cancels the password and notifies the user if it is guessable
- Proactive password checking where the system checks the password user gave
  initially and reject such password if it's not allowed
