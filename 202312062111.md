# Java XML Parsers

Java [XML](202305281742.md) parsers can be categorised into two ways of
operation, that is **in memory tree** and **event processing** (which can be
further broken down into *push parser* and *pull parser*). With in memory tree,
the parser traverses the entire file and creates DOM objects that correspond to
the nodes in XML file while preserving its tree-like hierarchy. With event
processing, the parser will generate an event that triggers the corresponding
event handler for the node when it encounters that node in the document. The
handler will apply the application logic to process the node specifically.

Examples are:
- [Document Object Model (DOM)](202312062316.md)
- [Simple API for XML (SAX)](202312062339.md)
- [Streaming API for XML (StAX)](202312062341.md)
