# Session Layer

Session Layer is the fifth layer in the #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
It manages the connections between hosts including session establishments and
releases. That is, it allows one-to-one [transport connection](202206131837.md)
to session or transparent many-to-one transport connections to session.
Furthermore, it also provides dialogue management, i.e., half-duplex, flip-flop
form of data exchange in which the data transmission by obtaining an imaginary
token between two session layers. Other services such as synchronisation,
activity management, and exception reporting are also provided by this layer.
The services and protocols in session layer are defined in ISO 8326 and 8327
respectively. Sometimes the application doesn't use all features in the layer,
thus, ISO defines subsets for this purpose which include kernel (all features),
basic combined subset (BCS), basic activity subset (BAS), and basic
synchronisation subset (BSS). Occasionally, it is referred to as Application
Layer with [Presentation Layer](202206131853.md) and [Application Layer](202206131856.md).

**Note**: It is possible to have consecutive sessions using single transport
connection, but [Multiplexing](202209091259.md) of sessions is not possible.

Examples of protocols operate in session layer:
