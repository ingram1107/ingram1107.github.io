# Data Encryption Standard (DES)

DES is an encryption standard that adheres to #[Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md).
It utilises [Feistel Cipher Structure](202210052211.md)#, by doing 16 rounds of
encrypting, where the underlying encryption method also exhibits
[Avalanche Effect](202210052302.md)# (34 bits and 35 bits difference for the
plaintext and the key). Both 64-bit plaintext and the 64-bit key will undergo
[permutation](202210052159.md) before going through the Feistel cipher structure
where only 56 bits of the key selected. The key will be left circular shifted in
order to produce subkeys (in 48 bits), which will be done 16 rounds like the
main encryption process. After 16 rounds, a 32-bit swap follows by an inverse
initial permutation will produce a 64-bit ciphertext.

**Note**: Avoid using key where its value is all 1s or 0s as the subkey
generated from the algorithm remained the same. And because of that, the order
for the subkeys in encryption and decryption doesn't matter since they are all
the same. Meaning, if we put the ciphertext encrypted with the key into
encryption algorithm once again, we'll get back the plaintext.

The initial permutation ($IP$) on the plaintext could be done by simply finding
the byte corresponding value in the table according to its position in the
table. The inverse of it ($IP^{-1}$) is just finding back the byte using the
table.

The substitution on the left half is done by XORing the output of the rounding
function with the right half and a subkey as parameters. The right half, size of
32-bit, will be expanded or permuted using Expansion table (E table) to produce
a 48-bit data which then XORs with the subkey. After that,
[substitution](202209281136.md)# will be done on the data with 8 S-boxes (each
with 16 columns and 4 rows, which is the backbone for the DES security
guarantees) that map 6 to 4 bits producing a 32-bit data which feed it to
another permutation (XOR with the left half later).

Working behind the S-boxes is by the logic that 2 outer bits (left and right
most bits) are map to the row of the S-box, and the inner bits are map to the
column of the S-box. For example, if the input bit sequence is 100110, then we
know the outer bits are 10, which is 2, illustrating the row number 2 in S-box.
The inner bits are 0011, which is 3, illustrating the column number 3 in S-box.
Referring to the row and column number, we could find the corresponding value in
the S-box, which we could substitute the bit sequence with its bit value.

**Note**: S-box is 0-index.

The subkey generation algorithm consists of three parts: initial permutation
(PC1), left cycle shift, and permutation with discards (PC2). PC1 will select
56-bits from the 64-bit key by discarding the $(8 \times n)$th bits, and halve
them into 28-bits, which then be feed into 16-round of left cycle shifts plus
PC2. For rounds 1, 2, 9, and 16, it shifts only *one bit*, while others shift
*two bits*. In PC2, it only selects each 24-bits from 28-bit halves by
discarding the $(9 \times n)$th bits, and permutes them with the PC2 table,
which will then used to XORs the permuted (by E table) right half of the data.

**Note**: The working on PC1 and PC2 are similar to IP. The corresponding bit
is found from referring to the row and column number of the bit located.

For decrypting, see [Feistel Cipher Structure](202210052211.md)# in detail. In
short, just encrypt the ciphertext with unwind subkeys order.

DES encrypts 64-bit of data using 56-bit key, which has been criticised of
having poor security due to the [small key size](202209281259.md), making it
vulnerable to possible [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md). [Analytic Attacks](202212172229.md)
are possible to crack DES. Other than that, smart-card implementation of DES is
susceptible to [Timing Attack](202210122125.md).

It is widely adopted by financial institution and other applications such as
[Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)](202212052200.md)#, [Kerberos](202202190818.md)#,
and [Unix Password Scheme](202301022333.md)#.

DES has several modes of operations which could be use depending on the
situation:
- [Electronic Codebook (ECB)](202210071130.md)#
- [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)](202210071133.md)#
- [Cipher Feedback (CFB)](202210071136.md)#
- [Output Feedback (OFB)](202210072044.md)#
- [Counter (CTR)](202210072049.md)#

It has several implementations as shown below:
- [Double Data Encryption Standard (2DES)](202210052316.md)#
- [Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)](202209012209.md)#
- [Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)](202209012213.md)#
