# Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

OFDM is a [Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)](202209091327.md) technique
that divides single wideband signal into large set of narrowband sub-carrier
where all sub-carrier to be orthogonal to each other are evenly spaced. It is
not subjected to the same intensity of multipath distortion of a single large
carrier. Sub-carriers are collected at the receiver and combined to form one
high-speed transmission.
