# Process-Persistent IPC

Process-persistent [IPC](202210262136.md) is a kind of IPC where the created
objects persist only within at most the lifetime of the process or until it
closes it, thus the name. Examples of this type of IPC are
[Pipe](202210280908.md) and [Named Pipe (FIFO)](202211080915.md).
