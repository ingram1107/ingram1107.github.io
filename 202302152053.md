# Interpreter

Interpreter is a #software simulation of machine, often a [Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md),
that decode the source program every time it is evaluated. Though such process
can be slow, it provides an easy source-level debugging as the run-time error
messages and refer to source-level units. The following flowchart shows its
procedures:

    sourceProg([Source Program])
    interpreter((Interpreter))

    sourceProg --> interpreter
```

There are two main methods an interpreter can use to evaluate an expression:
*normal-order evaluation* (fully expand the expression and then reduce) and
*applicative-order evaluation* (evaluate the arguments and then apply).
Generally, applicative-order evaluation is more efficient as it avoids potential
duplication of evaluation.
