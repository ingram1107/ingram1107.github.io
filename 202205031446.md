# Avoid Loops in Python

To improve Python program speed, avoid the loops such as `while` and `for` at
all cost if there are built-in functions could do the job. Libraries that are
based on fast programming languages, such as `numpy`, could be used to utilise
or improve the performance of a Python program. The best solution to replace a
loop, is to know the answer ahead of time by using pure #math equation.
