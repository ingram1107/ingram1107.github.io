# Common Lisp Dynamic Type Checking

#[202204251732](202204251732.md) provides some facilities for type checking in runtime. This
includes `check-type`. The following example shows a use case:

```lisp
(defun adder (n1 n2)
  (check-type n1 number) ; check if n1 == number
  (check-type n2 number) ; check if n2 == number
  (+ n1 n2))
```
