# Estimation Decomposition Techniques

Decomposition Techniques are a bunch of divide-and-conquer techniques trying to
figure out the [Project Estimation](202305132135.md). We can determine the
software size via direct approach ([LOC estimation](202305140755.md)) or
indirect approach ([FP estimation](202305140810.md)). The expected average
**weighted average** software size could be computed using the following
formula:

$$
S = \frac{S_{opt} + 4S_m + S_{pess}}{6}
$$

Where:
- $S$ is the expected value for the estimation variable
- $S_{opt}$ is the optimistic value
- $S_m$ is the most likely value
- $S_{pess}$ is the pessimistic value

Then, based on the metric involved, we could calculate the corresponding
estimated effort and estimated total costs based on person-month (assume 8-hour
work day, 160 work hours per month):

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Estimated effort} &=
\frac{\text{Metric}}{\text{Metric}/\text{Person-month}}\\
\text{Estimated total costs} &= \text{Estimated effort} \times \text{Labour
rate}
\end{align}
$$

**Note**: The estimated effort should always be rounded up.
