# etcd

`etcd` is a process running on [Kubernetes](202201291535.md)'s #[Kubernetes Master Node](202202012056.md)
that stores important [cluster](202304251207.md) data such as the state of
[Kubernetes Worker Node](202202012054.md). Those data will be updated once the
cluster changes such as dead pop and request from the client.
