# Decorator Pattern

Decorator Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that dynamically add
responsibilities or functionality to an object without the use of subclassing.
It is typically useful in creating visual interface (creating scrolling
functionality) for an object. There are four main components in Decorator:
**component** (lightweight interface), **concrete component** (which
responsibilities can be attached), **decorator** (maintains a reference to a
component object, defines an interface that conform to the component's
interface), and **concrete decorator** (where the responsibilities are added to
the component). The Decorator will forward the request to the component.

The Gang of Four advised to use Decorator whenever:
1. There is a need to dynamically and transparently (doesn't affect other
   objects) attach responsibilities to individual objects.
2. Responsibilities should be detached later.
3. Extension by subclassing is impractical (too many independent extensions to
   support).

Having Decorator can be more flexible than static inheritance as it avoids deep
hierarchy and hassles to extend features by subclassing an already complex
class. However, the Decorator is not identical to its component, thus one
shouldn't rely on object identity.

If the class have to change its behaviours dynamically, use [Strategy Pattern](202302172008.md)
instead.
