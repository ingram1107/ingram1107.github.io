# Factory Method

Factory Method is [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that defines an interface
for creating an object, but let subclasses have the autonomy to decide which
class to instantiate. In other words, the class instantiation or object creation
is delegated to the subclasses. Such object creation is done through a method
called Factory Method. There are four participants involved in this design
pattern: **product** (interface of objects the Factory Method creates),
**concrete product** (implement product interface), **creator** (defines Factory
Method that returns an object type of product), and **concrete creator**
(override factory method and return a concrete product object).

The Gang of Four advised to use it when:
1. The class can't know what kind of objects it must instantiate.
2. The class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
3. There is a need to delegate the responsibility to several helper subclasses
   and such delegation should be localised.
