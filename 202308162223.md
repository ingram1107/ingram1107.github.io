# POSIX IPC

[POSIX](202307131648.md) [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md)
functions all include a pathname parameter that must be begun with `/` and aided
by `#define` for portability. The alternative to this is to have a function that
allocates dynamic resource to the pathname with the aid of compile-time check of
the value from `POSIX_IPC_PREFIX` variable and formatting.

**Note**: `O_EXCL` flag will set the `errno` as `EEXIST` if the IPC object has
already exists.

`S_TYPEISMQ()` for message queue, `S_TYPEISSEM()` for semaphore, and
`S_TYPEISSHM()` for shared memory all take a pointer to `stat` struct, in which
should be filled by either `fstat()`, `lstat()`, or `stat()` to detect if the
IPC object is implemented as unique file type.
