# Dutch

Dutch (Nederlands) is a European language that is widely used in the
Netherlands. It is a close relative to Germanic languages, most prominently
German (Deutsch) and Flemish (Belgian German).

The "ch" and "g" resemble German's "ch"  and French's "r" which use the back of
the mouth. However, when "ch" is at the end of a word, it should instead
pronounce as "ss" (lengthen s).

"v" pronounce like "f", which is the same as in German.

Both "ou" and "au" sounds the same. They should be pronounced as "out" without
the "t". "ei" and "ij" sounds the same too, and their sounds are the same as how
you will say the letter "I".

"oe" is pronounced as "woo" with a bit of nose sound. "ui" sounds similar to
"eww" when you are disgusted, remember to be more drastic. "eu" sounds similar
to "oh" but with the mouth close. Pronounce "ie" as in letter "e".

If "ig" appears a postfix in a word (quite often in tenth in [dutch numbers](202302222012.md)),
it sounds like "ug".
