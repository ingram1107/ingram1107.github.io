# Kubernetes Namespace

Namespace is useful in grouping different #[202201291535](202201291535.md) components except
for [202201311634](202201311634.md)# and globally accessible components such as
[202201311647](202201311647.md)# and [202202111433](202202111433.md)#.

## Builtin-Namespaces

- `kubernetes-dashboard` is specific to [202202032024](202202032024.md) usage
- `kube-system` is used by system processes such as [202202012056](202202012056.md)
- `kube-public` should contain publicly accessible data such as [202201311643](202201311643.md)
- `kube-node-lease` contains the status of the [202202111433](202202111433.md)

## Advantages

1. Avoid conflicts between teams
2. Share resources between different deployment environments
3. Put resources into manageable group
4. Isolate and restrict different deployment environments
