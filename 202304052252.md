# Domain Relational Calculus

Domain relational calculus, like [Tuple Relational Calculus](202304052245.md),
is a [non-procedural query language](202303221404.md) with the difference of
using domain variables that take on values from the attribute domains instead of
tuples. QBE language largely base on domain relational calculus. Its expression
resembles [Set-Builder Notation](202204281700.md) but with slight deviation as
shown below:

$$
\{ < x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n > | P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \}
$$

Where:
- $x$ is a domain value or domain constant
- $P$ is a formula composed of atoms (domain operations or domain variables)

Unsafe situation, i.e., the requirement of infinite testing, might arise if we
allow values in the result that are not in the domain of the expression. Thus,
the following three rules should be obeyed:
1. All values appear in the tuples of the expression must be the values from the
   $dom(P)$.
2. For "there exists" subformula of form $\exists x (P_1(x))$, the subformula is
   true if and only if there is a value in $dom(P)$ such that $P_1(x)$ is true.
3. For "for all" subformula of form $\forall x (P_1(x))$, the subformula is true
   if and only if $P_1 (x)$ is true for all values $x$ from $dom(P)$.
