# Evolved Packet Core (EPC)

EPC simplifies every [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md) network
architecture and maintains higher [Throughput](202304111957.md), lesser
[Latency](202304111955.md), and [Mobility](202303292141.md) among legacy 3rd
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-based systems and non-3GPP system similar
to [WiMAX](202305181312.md) and CDMA 2000. It is similar to the System
Architecture Evolution (SAE) core. It consists of smaller components such as
[Mobility Management Entity (MME)](202305131741.md), [Serving Gateway (S-GW)](202305131747.md),
[PDN Gateway (P-GW)](202305131751.md), and [Home Subscriber Server (HSS)](202305131753.md).
