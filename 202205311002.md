# Science Funding

Current Science Funding in the US and Malaysia via *Research and Development*
(R&D) Grants is not sufficient and efficient to the academia. Scientists outside
the industry often facing overwork and burn out due to heavy administrative
works in order to secure grants. This means that scientists need to sacrifice
their research times for non-productive reason, and even with that, it is not
guarantee that they will get the funding they need.

The Grants are given arbitrarily since they need to go through human review. The
auditors are coming from various background and field, and obviously have biases
towards certain fields which heavily influenced their choice.

The reformists argue for a better process of science funding through **lottery**
instead of human review. Before the research is eligible for the grants, they
need to go through **peer review**, an existing process where the scientists
from the similar or same domain will evaluate the paper submitted. After that,
the research can apply for a grant. A lottery system will be set-up to bestow
the grant to a random research. This process of science funding will drastically
reduce the administrative tasks that the scientists hate to do.
