# Mobile Signal Fading

Mobile signal fading can be classified into:
- [Fast Fading](202305081322.md)
- [Slow Fading](202305081324.md)
- [Flat/Non-Selective Fading](202305081326.md)
- [Selective Fading](202305081327.md)

Fading could be addressed or compensated by *forward error correction* using
error correction coding, *adaptive equalisation* involving sophisticated signal
processing techniques, and *diversity* using multiple logical channels.
