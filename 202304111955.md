# Latency

Latency is a [measure](202304111951.md) on delay, that is the time required to
transfer data across a network. We can measure the latency with the following
two approaches:
- Synchronised clocks with extreme accuracy on both ends (hosts).
- Measure [Round-Trip Time (RTT)](202303292133.md) then divide by 2.

Two forms of measurement could be taken, one is active and another passive.
Active measurement involving traffic injection into the measured network, and
obviously its traffic can affect the network performance. Passive measurement,
on the other hand, only monitors the network and counts the passing packets
without injecting traffic. Example of a passive measurement is NetFlow,
standardised by [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](202210010845.md).

Even with the second approach, we still face the predicaments of several
uncertainties in network performance measurement due to *asymmetric routes*,
*rapid condition changes* (network technology advancements, multiple existing
incompatible technology, environment, varying speed, hardware differences),
*measurement affecting performance*, and *[bursty traffic](202209302043.md)*.
