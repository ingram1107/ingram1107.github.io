# Store-And-Forward Switching

Store-And-Forward Switching is a kind of #[switching mode](202207051907.md) that waits to receive the *entire frame* before forwarding. It will first read such a frame, then pass it to cyclic redundancy check (CRC). If the CRC is bad, the frame will be simply discarded, which could causes some latency but minimises errors at the same time.
