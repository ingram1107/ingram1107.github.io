# Data Access Control

Through the user access control procedure, i.e., log on, the system can
identify the user. For every user, there will be a unique profile that specifies
permissible operations and file accesses for that particular user. By then, the
#operating-system can enforce rules on the user based on that profile.

There are generally three models of data access control:
- *Access matrix* containing subject (the user), object (the target), and the
  access right.
- *Access control list* lists users and their permitted access right which could
  be a default or public entry.
- *Capability list* where user will have a number of capability tickets that
  specify authorised objects and operations for the user.
