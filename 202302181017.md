# The Reign of Caliph Abu Bakar Asy-Siddiq

Abu Bakar Asy-Siddiq is the first [Caliph](202302181011.md) elected right after
the death of prophet Muhammad. The rebellious Arab tribes, including the one
that was lead by Musailamal Al-Kazzab, immediately rose up against him as they
were discontent being ruled under the prophet, named by the historians as Ridda
Wars. Abu Bakar quickly squashed the rebellions by sending Khalid Al-Walid, and
later dispatched him for northern expedition with some successes. The start of
the collection of Al-Quran leaded by [Uthman bin Affan](202302241122.md)
happened during the reign of caliph Abu Bakar.
