# Synchronous Exception

Synchronous exception is an [Exception](202405222000.md) raised by internal
events, usually coming from the process instruction execution. This includes
arithmetic error (division by zero, overflow), memory read or write failures,
access to non-existent hardware or software etc.

It could be precise where the program counter can point to the cause or
imprecise. The former is commonly found in architecture using predictive
instruction and data loading, [caching](202403191017.md) mechanism. The latter
found in architectures using heavy [Pipelining](202303141909.md) or
[prefetch](202403210909.md) algorithm.
