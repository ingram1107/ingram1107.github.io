# register

`register` is a C keyword to hint on the compiler in order to store the variable
in processor register instead of in memory. However, this can only happen in the
function scope, that is within the function itself. It is advised to use it on
frequently used variable in order to [optimise](202203011139.md)# the performance.

The side effect of the identifier `register` is that it could avoid
[202205171500](202205171500.md)# for variables in the function scope.

**Note**: `register` cannot be used together with [202202111824](202202111824.md) as both of
them are storage specifier and C don't allow to have more than one of them.
