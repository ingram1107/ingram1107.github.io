# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

SLA is a contractual agreement that specifies the performance and
[Availability](202210022157.md) guarantees that a provider promises to deliver,
including the penalties in the case of violations.

A typical SLA should include the roles and responsibilities, business-level
policies, services and deployment models, critical performance objectives,
security and privacy requirements, service-failure management, disaster recovery
plan, effective management process, and exit process. When evaluating it, we
have to inspect its service guarantee (performance and data), service guarantee
time period, service guarantee granularity, service acceptable usage policy,
service guarantee exclusions, service credit to consumer, service violation
detection and measurements, service restorations, service renewals, service
activation and deactivation, service excess use, and service transferability.
