# Data Centre Virtualisation

[Data Centre](202210012205.md) can be virtualised by delegating storage and
computing resources with VFrame. VFrame is then responsible for configuring the
underlying disk arrays and computers to create the application environments.

The migration of physical data centres to data centre virtualisation starts from
the consolidation (centralisation) of the server and storage servers. Then,
implement a unified interconnect fabric running [Ethernet](202207051550.md) to
enable shared pools of computer and storage servers, in which we are able to
virtualise the server and I/O services. In the end, this allows the applications
to be mapped dynamically to required resources.
