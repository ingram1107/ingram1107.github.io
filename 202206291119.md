# Photovoltaic (PV)

PV is a technology that generate #[202206291055](202206291055.md) by exploiting
the photovoltaic effect, which directly convert lights into electricity, using
semiconductor materials. It is often employed as a system (PV system) which
consists of several solar panels which converts lights into direct current (DC),
a solar inverter that covert DC into alternating current (AC) to make it fit
into the power grid, photovoltaic mounting systems, solar cables etc. It may
include the use of a solar tracking system which orients the payload toward the
sun and an integrated battery.

Since it comes in variety of size, PV can be cheap to employed compare to
[202206291103](202206291103.md). Even if such system is installed in large
scale, it would be much cheaper due to the ever decreasing price of PV because
of the high demand. [Utility-Scale Solar Energy Planning for
Egypt](lit/@Galal2013.md)
In high solar radiation region, though, PV might not have an edge to the CSP.
Furthermore, it is susceptible to the temperature as the rise of the Celsius
will decrease the open circuit voltage VOC, which affect the efficiency of the
PV.

Additionally, it doesn't have a sufficient mean to store generated renewable
energy other than using batteries which are coming from lead-acid,
nickel-cadmium or lithium-ion.

It is the most widely adopted solar power generation method around the globe.
