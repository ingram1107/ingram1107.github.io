# Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)

WPAN is a [wireless network](202303301607.md) which cover a short distance up
to 10 meters. It usually has lower data rates than most [Wireless LAN (WLAN)](202302161710.md)
technologies and can't exist without a hive node (main node), but with the
advantage of being lower cost and lower power consumption.
