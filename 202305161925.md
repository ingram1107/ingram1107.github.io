# PHP Type Conversion

PHP Type conversion can be done through `settype()` function or type casting
like in [C](202302190647.md) and [C++](202302190651.md). See
[W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_var_settype.asp) for more
information. In contrast, we can know a variable's type by examining the return
value of `gettype()` function.
