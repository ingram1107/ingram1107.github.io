# MANET Proactive Protocol

[MANET](202404261949.md) proactive protocol works by discovering a path when
there is a need of transmitting a packet and there is no known path exists. Upon
routing failure, it should attempt to alter the path.

Examples of MANET proactive protocol are:
- Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR)
