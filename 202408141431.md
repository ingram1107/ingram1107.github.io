# Java Security Management System

Java Security Management System provides the mean to enhance site protection
where the information are secured locally. Local codes are trusted while remote
codes are deemed untrusted unless it is signed digitally by a trusted source.
Untrusted codes will be executed in an isolated sandbox and have only limited
access to local system resources. Both local and remote codes are checked by the
same security management system.

It provides a fine-grained, flexible, and easy to specify security and
permission policies.
