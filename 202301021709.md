# Password Guessing

Password Guessing is the most common way for [Password Acquisition](202301021707.md)#.
The attacker will attempt to guess the password for a login based on well-known
information (public or phished information). The success of this method
depends on how much does the #operating-system do to protect the password file
and how secure is the password chosen by the user.

The guessed password could be based on:
- default password for the application
- short words (1 to 3 characters)
- all words in an electronic dictionary (60, 000 entries)
- personal information about user such as hobbies, social security number,
  birthday etc.
- licence plate numbers
- information gathered from [line tapping or Trojan horse](202301021720.md)#

A countermeasure to this method is to have a mechanism for the system to detect
abnormal number of failed logins or against stolen password file. Such mechanism
should be able to trigger necessary action denying the malicious access even if
the password is correct. From the user side, a good password should be
[selected](202301022351.md)#, preferably long password due to the limitation of
[brute force attempt](202209281259.md)#.
