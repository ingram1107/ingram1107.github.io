# Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP)

IDP is a connectionless, unreliable [Network Layer](202206131702.md)
[Protocol](202209302229.md) that provides packet delivery service for
[XNS](202303021149.md) protocols. It is the equivalent of [Internet Protocol (IP)](202206151223.md)
in [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md) with some minor
differences. An XNS address contains [32-bit network address](202206151453.md),
[48-bit host address](202206151451.md), and 16-bit port number (called socket in
XNS).

An IDP packet contains a 30-byte header with fields:
- source XNS address
- destination XNS address
- checksum (unlike IP, this is for the entirety of the packet)
- length of data (0 to 546 bytes)
- packet type (SPP, PEX, etc.)

**Note**: Most Xerox systems enforce a maximum packet size of 576 bytes for IDP
packet.

Because the IDP directly contains the port number information its header, it can
demultiplexes the incoming datagram by itself. Therefore, IDP can be used
directly by the user for unreliable connection. Other protocols are able to
receive packets from another protocol as well.
