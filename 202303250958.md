# Architectural Style

Style defines a vocabulary of [design element types](202303242154.md) and rules
for composing them. It represents families of related
[Systems](202303242148.md). Some styles do prescribe a framework as a set of
structural forms that specific applications can apply. Examples of styles are
data flow architecture, [blackboard architecture](202207041156.md), layered
systems, multistage compiler framework, 3-tiered client-server systems,
[OSI protocol stack](202206131632.md), and user interface management system.
