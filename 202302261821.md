equivalent to English's "to be" or "to have". The following table shows its
conjugation form:

| Hebben            | Meaning       |
| ---               | ---           |

**Note**: In a [question](202302221947.md), like in "zijn, "hebt" for "jij" and
"je" will loss its "t" in the sentence. Meaning the proper question form is "Heb
jij dorst?" ("Are you thirsty?").
