# decltype

`decltype` is a type deduction specifier in [C++](202302190651.md) which deduce
the value type to its declaration form. The value could be a name, an
expression, or keywords such as `auto`. The following shows an example usage:

```cpp
auto add(auto x, auto y) -> decltype(x + y)
{
  return x + y;
}
```

Because of its stringent type deduction strategy, it is often advised to use it
carefully especially when used in guessing the function's return type. If the
function is intended to return a reference type, `decltype` is the way to go.
Otherwise, stick to the keyword `auto` which guarantee to be a value instead of
a reference.
