# Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)

RTP is an [Application Layer](202206131856.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md) that
be used to transmit real-time data across the internet with the deployment of
[jitter buffer](202304092135.md) on the receiver side. It is done by the
inclusion of the packet of **sequence number** (place incoming packets in
correct order and detect missing packets), **timestamp** (play the packet in
the correct time), and **a series of source identifiers**. The underlying
transport protocol used is [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md), thus
RTP doesn't guarantee the timely delivery of the data.
