# Depth First Search (DFS)

Depth First Search is an algorithm that could do a pre-order [202112102054](202112102054.md)#
search on either [202112101956](202112101956.md) or [202204112045](202204112045.md).

DFS could be used for:
- finding [202205022012](202205022012.md)# of [202204112129](202204112129.md)
- determine [202205101200](202205101200.md)# and [202205101149](202205101149.md)#
- solving [202206091105](202206091105.md)#

## Details

- If using against an #[202204112129](202204112129.md) which is not connected or
  #[202204112118](202204112118.md) that is not strongly connected, repeatedly call DFS on the
  unvisited nodes in order to visit all nodes in the graph.

## Analysis

- The work runtime complexity for it is $O(\vert E \vert \times \vert V \vert)$.
  This could be improved to $O(\vert E \vert)$ if the data structure is a
  [202112101956](202112101956.md).

## Attention

- To avoid having an infinite loop, DFS must mark the visited nodes.

## Implementation

```c
void Dfs(Vertex V)
{
  Visited[V] = True;
  for each W adjacent to V
    if (!Visited[W])
      Dfs(W);
}
```
