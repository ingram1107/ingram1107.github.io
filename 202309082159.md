# Sabah Politics

In Sabah, there is no single dominant ethnic unlike in [Malaya Peninsular](202309082050.md).
Its demographic can be categorised into Muslim ethnics including Bajau, Idahan,
Iranum, Bisaya, Orang Sungai, and Sulu, and non-Muslim ethnics including Kadazan
Dusun, Murut, and Rungus. Among them, Kadazan Dusun is the largest ethnic,
occupies around 25% of the population.

Initially, the Alliance Party (Parti Perikatan), composed of United Sabah
National Organisation (UNKO), United Sabah National Organisation (USNO), and
Sabah Chinese Association (SCA), lead the election results from 1963 until 1967.
UNKO was established in 1961 and lead by Donald Stephen. USNO, representing
Muslim aboriginal people's interests, was under the leadership of Tun Dato'
Mustapha Dato' Haron.

This dominance was broke by Sabah People's United Front (Parti Bersatu Rakyat
Jelata Sabah, BERJAYA) by winning the 1976 Sabah state election under Harris
Salleh's leadership. Later, United Sabah Party (Parti Bersatu Sabah, PBS)
defeats BERJAYA in 1985 Sabah state election. National Front (BN) from the
peninsular managed to defeat PBS in 1994 state election despite the latter
winning a slip majority due to the split of Yong Teck Lee into Sabah Progressive
Party (Parti Maju Sabah, SAPP). The poor election result further split the party
into United Sabah People's Party (Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah, PBRS) and Sabah
Democratic Party (Parti Demokratik Sabah, PDS).
