# Transcriptome

Transcriptome is a collection of transcripts ([mRNA](202308082154.md)) present
in a given cell. Sometimes called gene expression profiling, it measures the
expression of thousands of genes in the form of mRNA to create a global picture
of cellular function.

DNA microarray and RNA-seq can be used to study the gene expression pattern of
multiple genes.
