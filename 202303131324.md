# Adapter Pattern

Adapter Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that adapts an otherwise
incompatible class interface to another class interface where the user is
expected to interact with. Essentially, it gives the object a new interface. The
pattern can be implemented by subclassing a domain-specific class to inherit the
interface that the client will interact with, in which the subclass is the
Adapter. Then, the adapter calls the corresponding functionality of adaptee
adhering to its interface. There are two kinds of Adapter implementation:
**class adapter** (with private inheritance from the adaptee) and **object
adapter** (with [composition](202302051222.md)). The former is good for
overriding the adaptee's behaviours but inflexible to adapt whereas the latter
is the opposite of it.

The Gang of Four suggested using this pattern when:
1. The existing class interface is not compatible to the one we need.
2. There are unrelated or unforeseen classes that need to be cooperated and
   reused.
3. It's impractical to adapt several existing subclasses' interface by
   subclassing everyone.
