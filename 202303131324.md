# Adapter Pattern

Adapter Pattern is a [Design Pattern](202211221249.md) that adapts an otherwise
incompatible class interface to another class interface where the user is
expected to interact with. Essentially, it gives the object a new interface. The
pattern can be implemented by subclassing a domain-specific class to inherit the
interface that the client will interact with, in which the subclass is the
Adapter. Then, the adapter calls the corresponding functionality of adaptee
adhering to its interface. There are two kinds of Adapter implementation:
**class adapter** (with private inheritance from the adaptee) and **object
adapter** (with [composition](202302051222.md)). The former is good for
overriding the adaptee's behaviours but inflexible to adapt whereas the latter
is the opposite of it.

We can build interface adaptation by implementing **pluggable adapters**. These
adapters will have narrow interface defined, that is the smallest subset of
operations that let us do the adaptation. There are three implementations for
pluggable adapter: *implements abstract operations from domain-specific class*,
*forwards the requests to a [delegate](202302051232.md) object* (different
[Strategy](202302172008.md) can be done with different delegate objects),
and *parametirised an adapter into one or more blocks*. The third implementation
requires the #programming-language support for block construct where a block can
adapt a request, and the adapter stores the block for each individual request.

The Gang of Four suggested using this pattern when:
1. The existing class interface is not compatible to the one we need.
2. There are unrelated or unforeseen classes that need to be cooperated and
   reused.
3. It's impractical to adapt several existing subclasses' interface by
   subclassing everyone.
