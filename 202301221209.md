# Circuit-Level Gateways

Circuit-Level Gateways is a standalone system or specialised function
(determining which connections will be allowed) performed by an
[Application-Level Gateways](202301221202.md). The gateway works in the
[Session Layer](202206131849.md)#. It sets up two TCP connections: one between
itself and the outside host, another one between itself and the inside host.
Once the connections are established, it relays the TCP segments without further
peeking into the content.

The system assumes that the internal users do not have malicious intent.
Examples of a Circuit-Level Gateway is SOCKS package.
