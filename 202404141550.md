# Pre-emptive Priority System

Pre-emptive priority system is a [System](202303242148.md) that assigns fixed or
dynamic priority labels to [Processes](202210062301.md). The label shows the
urgency of the task associated with the interrupt. However, high-priority tasks
may abuse it by hogging computing resources leading to starvation.
