# Error Control Coding

Error Control Coding is a practical solution to enable acceptable
[Information](202210052143.md)# quality in a channel with fixed
$\frac{E_b}{N_0}$ (from #[Channel Capacity Theorem](202210290901.md)). To
achieve acceptable error performance, Error Control Coding usually trade-offs
bandwidth and system complexity (due to redundancy from #[Channel Encoder](202209291041.md)).

Error Control Codes could be classified into:
- [Block Code](202210290914.md)#
- [Convolutional Code](202211032216.md)#

There are several schemes for Error Control Coding:
- [Linear Block Coding](202211041839.md)#
