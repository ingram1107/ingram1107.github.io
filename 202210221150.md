# Triple A (AAA)

AAA refers to [Authentication](202210040915.md)# (who are you),
[Authorisation](202210221159.md)# (what can you do) and
[Accounting](202210221202.md)# (what did you do).

An AAA server should be attached to a network access point (whether it is a
network access server, [Router](202207061800.md), or terminal server). The user
will request access to the network, which the AAA server compares the
user-supplied authentication data, forwarded by the network access point, with
its database stored user-associated data to see if the information match. If it
matched, Authroisation will take place to see what services do this user have
access to, and later records their activities within the network.

There are several implementations of AAA:
- [Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)](202210221318.md)#
- [Diameter](202210221333.md)#
