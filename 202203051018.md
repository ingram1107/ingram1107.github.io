Lenin stated that Imperialism, [the highest stage of capitalism](202205021551.md)#
has several features:

1. The concentration of the production and capital (formation of capitalist
   union) that developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies
   that dominate the economic life.
2. The merging of bank capital and industrial capital, and the creation, on the
   basis of this "financial capital", of financial oligarchy.
3. The export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities
   acquires exceptional importance.
4. The formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share
   the world among themselves.
5. The territorial divisions of the whole world among the biggest capitalist
   powers has been completed.

against other imperialist states. It will also use tariff barriers as a mean of
economic warfare against its rivals.
