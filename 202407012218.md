# Block-Mode Device

Block-mode device transfers structured data one block at a time, with the block
size determined by the underlying hardware. Transfer protocol must be enforced.

To write smaller blocks, the device driver could first perform a read operation
of the affected block, replace it with the new data, and then written back the
modified block. Another approach is to accumulate the data in the driver cache,
in which if enough data has accumulated for a required block size, a write
operation will be performed.
