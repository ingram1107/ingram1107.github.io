# Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT is the connection of millions of smart devices and sensors connected to the
Internet. It necessitates the use of [IPv6](202206281129.md). IoT can be in the
form of [Sensor](202404061101.md), [Actuator](202404061105.md), or other
intelligent devices.

Controllers in a sensor networks are responsible for collecting data from the
latter and provide network connectivity to them. They may have the ability to
make immediate action or send data to more powerful computer for processing.

Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and [Intent-Based Networking (IBN)](202408142331.md)
can be used to enhance the capabilities of IoT devices.
