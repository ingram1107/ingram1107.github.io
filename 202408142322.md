# Internet of Things (IoT)

IoT is the connection of millions of smart devices and sensors connected to the
Internet. It necessitates the use of [IPv6](202206281129.md). IoT can be in the
form of [Sensor](202404061101.md), [Actuator](202404061105.md), or other
intelligent devices such as [Controller](202409101358.md). Those connections can
be *device-to-device*, *device-to-[Cloud](202210012158.md)*,
*device-to-gateway-to-cloud*, or *device-to-gateway-to-cloud-to-application*.

Due to increasing number of devices, non-traditional location of devices,
changing type and quantity of gathered data, and lack of upgradeability, IoT
poses challenges on device security.

In Cisco IoT System, it provides a solution with six pillars: network
connectivity, [Fog Computing](202408142317.md), [Cybersecurity](202408141950.md)
and [Physical Security](202409101314.md), [Data Analytics](202409100023.md),
Management and [Automation](202409100037.md), and application enablement
platform.

There are organisations trying to standardise IoT architectures and frameworks.
Those are:
- Industrial Internet Consortium
- OpenFog Consortium
- Open Connectivity Foundation

IoT devices usually deploy specialised protocols with low power requirement and
limited connectivity. Examples of such protocols are Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP) and [MQTT](202409101421.md).

To foster great security guarantee on IoT network, the devices deployed must
adhere to a secure framework that defines [Authentication](202210022151.md),
[Authorisation](202210221159.md), network enforced policy, and secure analytics.
