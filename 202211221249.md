# Design Pattern

Design Pattern is a communicating object and class that is customised to solve a
general design problem in a particular context.[^gangOfFour] It abstrats and
identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make an object and
class reusable.

Several Design Patterns are presented below:
- [State Pattern](202210211637.md)#
- [Null Object Pattern](202211162216.md)#
- [Observer Pattern](202211231132.md)#
- [Singleton Pattern](202211231900.md)#
- [Mediator Pattern](202211241530.md)#
- Composite Pattern# (nested views)
- Strategy Pattern# (view-controller relationship)
- Factory Method# (default controller class)
- Decorator# (scrolling to a view)
