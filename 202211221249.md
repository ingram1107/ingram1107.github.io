# Design Pattern

Design Pattern is a communicating object and class that is customised to solve a
general design problem in a particular context.[^gangOfFour] It abstrats and
identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make an object and
class reusable.

We know that an application, a toolkit or a framework needs to be redesign using
a Design Pattern when:
- the creation of an object needs to explicitly specify a class
- there is a dependency on specific operations
- there is a dependency on hardware and software platform
- there is a dependency on object representations or implementations
- there is a dependency on algorithms
- the coupling is tight (highly depending classes on each other)
- functionality extension have to be done by subclassing
- it is unable to alter classes conveniently

Design Patterns could be roughly classified into three categories:
- Creational Design Patterns
- Structural Design Patterns
- Behavioural Design Patterns

Several Design Patterns are presented below:
- [State Pattern](202210211637.md)#
- [Null Object Pattern](202211162216.md)#
- [Observer Pattern](202211231132.md)#
- [Singleton Pattern](202211231900.md)#
- [Mediator Pattern](202211241530.md)#
- Composite Pattern# (nested views)
- Strategy Pattern# (view-controller relationship)
- Factory Method# (default controller class)
- Decorator# (scrolling to a view)
- Memento# (save object's state)

Figure below shows the relationship between each Design Pattern:
