# Family Members in Dutch

For the close family, Dutch has a dedicated noun for it, i.e., "het gezin". It
includes parents ("ouders"), father ("vader"), mother ("moeder"), son ("zoon"),
daughter ("dochter"), sister ("zus"), and brother ("broer"). If your brother or
sister is biological only related to one of your parents, you can call them
"halfbroer" (halfbrother) and "halfzus" (halfsister). If they are not related,
then call them "stiefbroer" (stepbrother) and "stiefzus" (stepsister). Notice
the prefix "half" and "stief" here. Family ("familie") includes deeper and wider
hierarchy, including grandparents ("grootouders"), grandfather ("opa"),
grandmother ("oma"), grandchildren ("kleinkinderen"), aunt ("tante"), uncle
("oom"), sister-in-law ("schoonzus"), brother-in-law ("zwager"), nephew
("neefje"), and niece ("nichtje"). However, there is no counterpart of "cousins"
in Dutch, they are called "neefje" and "nichtje" instead.
