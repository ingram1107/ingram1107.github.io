# Unit Testing

Unit test is codes that exercise a module (exactly one) and compare the result
of it to the expected output. The testing should be done in an *isolated
environment* (controlled conditions) where we'll check the return value of the
component against known values or results from previous runs of the same test
([Regression Testing](202206201335.md)). Try not to test many things like
logical decisions in a single test case.

It is #[recommended](202206201159.md) testing the subcomponents first before
testing on the main module in which we'll have a composable testing facility.
However, don't test every public method if they are too simple to test as
advised by [Fowler](lit/@Fowler1999.md).

The tips on writing effective Unit Tests is to think of the boundary conditions
under which things might go wrong. It includes possible raised #exception.
Concentrate our tests there with a mindset of trying to break the test by
specifying possible special cases.

Sometimes, we do write some simple tests while debugging. **Don't toss away
them**. Formalise those tests into the test suit.

With unit testing in mind, developer will consciously design a program that is
[highly modular](202202041514.md)#. [Regression Testing](202206201335.md)# could
be implemented to further enhance the validity of the written unit tests to see
whether they are adhered to the specified requirements.
