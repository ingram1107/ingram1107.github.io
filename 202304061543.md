# Modulation of Radio Carrier

Modulation is done on the [radio carrier](202302161842.md) by superimposing
(laying on) transmitted data on the radio carrier, so they can be accurately
extracted at the receiving end. This means that the radio signal occupies more
than a single frequency. The radio receiver tunes in one radio frequency while
rejecting other radio signals on different frequencies to extract the data.
