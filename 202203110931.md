# Polyphase Merge

Polyphase Merge is used when there are only $k + 1$ drives or tapes where $k$
represent an even number. It will first split the file contents into runs that
resemble Fibonacci number. Note that all the runs have been sorted using one of
the [202203102004](202203102004.md).

Since the split is uneven, there will always be a split that finished earlier
than the other. We will merge the smallest Fibonacci number in the previous pass
of runs into the empty drive or tape, and split the remaining runs into the
other drive or tape that does not obtain that number. Apply
[the recursive assumption](202202151731.md), we will then run the progress all
over again until we merge all the runs.

This distribution strategy could be used to extend the [202203102233](202203102233.md) where
the $k$th order of Fibonacci number is defined as $F^{(k)}(N) = F^{(k)}(N - 1) +
F^{(k)}(N - 2) + \cdots + F^{(k)}(N - k)$ with initial conditions of $F^{(k)}(N)
= 0, 0 \le N, \le k - 2, F^{(k)}(k - 1) = 1$.
