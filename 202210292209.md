# Polyalphabetic Cipher

Polyalphabetic Cipher is a [Substitution Cryptographic](202209281136.md)
#algorithm where the same plaintext letter could be replaced by several
ciphertext letters depending on its position in plaintext. The relationship
between a character in the plaintext and a character in the ciphertext is
one-to-many, thus make it hard to crack using [Frequency Analysis](202210292203.md)#
and more secure than [Monoalphabetic Cipher](202210292134.md).

However, it is not without possible attacks. If the key length is too short,
then [Kasiski Method](202210302317.md)# could be used to crack out the
plaintext.

The following examples employed some form of Polyalphabetic Cipher:
