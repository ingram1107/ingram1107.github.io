# Shotgun Sequencing

Shotgun sequencing is a [DNA Sequence Technologies](202308171956.md) that break
up [DNA](202308082154.md) into random numerous small segments called
which are sequence using [Chain Termination Method/Sanger Sequencing](202308171957.md)
to obtain [Reads](202308172001.md). The overlapping ends of different reads is
used to assemble into a continuous sequence in order to obtain the full
[Genome](202308152055.md) sequence. This process is named [de novo assembly.](202308172010.md)
However, this assembly is made difficult by the presence of repetitive
sequences.
