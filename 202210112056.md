# Routing Table

Routing Table is a data file in #[Router](202207061800.md) that is used to store
route information about *directly connected networks* and *remote networks*.
Directly connected network is defined as a network that is directly attached to
one of the router's interface. Conversely, remote network is a network that is
not directly attached to the router.

Remote networks could be added to the Routing Table by either relying on
[Routing Protocol](202207061815.md)# (dynamic routing) or manually configured by
network administrator ([Static Routing](202211051028.md)#).
