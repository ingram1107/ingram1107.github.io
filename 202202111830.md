# extern

`extern` is a #[202205171449](202205171449.md).

By default, all defined functions and local variables are implicitly declared as
`extern`. This means that the external sources can call the function defined in
this file.

If a *global* variable is defined as `extern`, it will instead import the
variable from where it is defined.
