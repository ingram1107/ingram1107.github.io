# Relationship Between Problem Report, Symptoms and Defects

1. A *problem report* can have one or more symptoms.
2. A *symptom* can be caused by one or more defects.
3. The evidence of *defect* can be observed by one or more symptoms.

**Note**: Interview the user who reported the bug in order to gather sufficient
level of detail about the dysfunction.

**Note**: A bug report could mean that [test assets](202206201159.md)# don't
cover enough area of the application. Write thorough test based on boundary
conditions and realistic [end-user usage](202206201428.md)#.
