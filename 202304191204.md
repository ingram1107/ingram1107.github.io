# Goodput

Goodput is a kind of [Throughput](202304111957.md) that measure the
**effective** data rate achieved by an application. It is mostly how user feel
about the network performance. It is unlikely to achieve the same data rate from
stated [Network Capacity](202304191208.md) due to protocol overhead such as
sending packet headers, trailers, and control information, imposing [window or receive buffer](202303141902.md)
size limit, protocols for [name](202209300947.md) and/or [address resolution](202209301002.md),
[handshaking](202206151232.md) (connection initiation and termination),
transmission rate reduction during [Network Congestion](202209302043.md), and
packet retransmission. By such, it puts the goodput on dependence of the
[Protocol Suite](202209302301.md).
