# Replay Attack

Replay Attack is one of the form of #[Modification](202209261922.md). It works
like this: the intruder will capture data unit while being the middle of the
man, and then send a modified version of the data to the user which could
contain malicious information.

Replay Attack could be prevented using [Nonce](202210211901.md)#, where the
machines will use an arbitrary number (random) embedded to the communication
[Protocol](202209302229.md) to recognise each other.
