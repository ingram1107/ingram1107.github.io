# Indian Civilisation

India, in Devanagari, Bhārat (भारत), gets its name from Bhāratavarṣa (भारतं वर्)
or Bhārata Kṣetra in Sanskrit. Historically, Jambudvīpa (जम्बुद्वीप in Sanskrit)
was used before the widespread usage of the former terms especially in
South-East Asia. The term India is originated from the Indus River, coming from
the Greek.

Indian civilisation could be divided into several parts including pre-history,
Vedic period, Maurya dynasty, Gupta Empire, [Islamic Age](202309061931.md),
Portuguese and Dutch colonial rule, British administration (lasted until 1947),
and Independence.
