# Terminal Node Controller (TNC)

TNC consists of a modem, a [Microprocessor](202404051142.md), and a required
circuitry for communication between TNC and [PC](202410081117.md). It is
responsible for data decoding and encoding from PC, error checking, and
modulation or demodulations to or from radio frequencies before sending data to
the radio.

TNC can be replaced by a sound card interface with a specialised software like
AGW Packet Engine (AGWPE).

Radio with built-in TNC may be restricted to be used for [APRS](202410081132.md).
