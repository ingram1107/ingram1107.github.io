# Protein Tertiary Structure Prediction Template-Based Methods

Template-based methods for [Protein Structure Prediction](202310291139.md)
include *[comparative or homology modelling](202310300837.md)* and
*[protein threading or fold recognition](202310301155.md)*. In these methods,
the higher the [homology](202308160957.md) of a target is, the better the model
will be.
