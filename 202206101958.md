# Generalisation

Generalisation is a valid form of #[202205062050](202205062050.md) where we can deduce a premise to a wider context. It has the following form:

$$
\begin{align}
&p\\
\therefore \ &p \lor q
\end{align}
$$

Here is the example to better understood the Generalisation. Let's say you know that the shirt is made of fiber. You can say that the shirt is either made of fiber or made of nylon. Such conclusion is valid and true.
