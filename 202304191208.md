# Network Capacity

 Network capacity or #hardware capacity in networking often expressed in terms
 of maximum [Throughput](202304111957.md) based on the approximation of the
 potential throughput, which set an upper bound on the network performance. It
 is unlikely that the [Goodput](202304191204.md) could achieve the network
 capacity due to the overhead from [Protocol](202209302229.md).
