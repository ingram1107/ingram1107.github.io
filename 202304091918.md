# Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

STLC generally has the following phases:
1. Requirements/Design review (product reports about review defect)
2. Test planning (test plain, test estimation, test schedule)
3. Test designing (test based on #software [Requirement](202303251303.md) or
   design, deliver test cases, scripts, or data and [Requirement Traceability](202304011137.md)
   matrix)
4. Test environment setup (replicate end user's environment)
5. Test execution (execute test in test environment, write down test results
   incrementally and produce defect reports)
6. Test reporting (final test result, test/defect metrics, test closure report,
   Who Worked Late and on Weekends, WWLW report)
