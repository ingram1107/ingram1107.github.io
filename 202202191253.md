# enum

`enum` is a list of constant `signed int` that implicitly starts from 0. Its
value must be of literals that could be known at **compile time** which means
that the values should not be a result of a *function call* or an *object
evaluation*.

The syntax is as follows:
```c
enum constants {
  FIRST, // 0
  SECOND = 3,
  THIRD = 2 * SECOND,
};
```

## In CPP

To enforce type safety in `enum` in C++, one could apply the modifier `class` to
the `enum` like the following:

```cpp
enum class Color { red, green, blue };
```

By then, we can only access the variable `red` with the scope `Color`, like
`Color::red`. This avoids the variable been declared in global scope so that we
could declare another variable `red` in different scope.
