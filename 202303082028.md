# Malicious DHCP Server

An [Intruder](202301021642.md) can pretend to be a legitimate
[DHCP](202206151645.md) server and usurp the control or network access of
legitimate user's device. This can be prevented with DHCP snooping in which the
DHCP requests per port is rate-limited and bogus DHCP responses are blocked.
