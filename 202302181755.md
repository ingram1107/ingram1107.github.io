# CMake

For version control, we can define common configuration flags such as variables,
build directory, generator etc. for the project in the file CMakePresets.json.

When including other files, keywords such as `PRIVATE`, `INTERFACE` and `PUBLIC`
are important to indicate who are the user for the underlying files included.
`PRIVATE` states that only given target will use it, `INTERFACE` states that
only consuming targets will use it, whereas `PUBLIC` states that both given and
consuming targets can use it. [^hoffman2022] In general, it is advised to place
source or implementation files under `PRIVATE` where the interface files placed
under `INTERFACE`. For example, to include headers from a directory named
`src/`, we can declare:

```cmake
target_sources(target_name
    PRIVATE
    # include source or implementation files
    INTERFACE
        FILE_SET HEADERS
        BASE_DIRS src
        FILES ...)
```

**Note**: The syntax has a slide change for [C++ Module](202302181717.md) due to
the introduction of `cxx_modules` option for the `FILE_SET`.
