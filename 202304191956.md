# Entity Set

Entity set is a [Set](202204281446.md) of [Entities](202304191954.md) of the
same type that share the same properties. The actual collection or instances of
entities, especially in [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md),
are called an extension.

If all entities in an entity set participate in at least one [Relationship Set](202304200933.md),
then this can be called as a *total participation*. In contrast, if only some of
them are, then it is a *partial participation*. If the participation is total
and the [Mapping Cardinality](202304290909.md) is many-to-one for one entity
set, we can combine the entity set to one another into a single
[schema](202302101331.md) where the merged entity set's primary key was chosen.
If the participation is partial, there could be null value within the entity
sets. For one-to-one relationship, either entity sets could be merged into each
other.

**Note**: When merging entity sets, we have to drop the foreign key constraint
that is referencing on the merged entity set and add other foreign key
constraints to the combined entity set.

We say that an entity set is a **weak entity set** if it doesn't have sufficient
[Attributes](202304200943.md) to form a [primary key](202302101331.md) to
uniquely identify the entities it contained. This means it relies on foreign key
to another entity, usually one or more **strong entity sets** (that have a
primary key). We use a set of attributes, called *discriminator* or partial key,
to distinguish the entities in a weak entity set. In mathematical sense,
$\text{primary key in weak entity set} = \text{primary key of identifying sets} + \text{discriminator}$.
This creates a dependency to the entity set that the weak entity set referring
to, and we call this [Relationship](202304192107.md) as identifying relationship
(typically many entities in weak entity set to one entity in strong entity set)
and the entity set referred by it as identifying or owner entity set. The
primary key of the identifying key will put foreign key contraint on the weak
entity set, and it should be on delete cascade. There will be no descriptive
attributes to the identifying relationship as it is likely to be part of the
weak entity set. Other than identifying relationship, weak entity set is free of
participating on other relationships and even as an identifying relationship to
another weak entity set.

**Note**: A weak entity set may be converted to a multivalued composite
attribute in the identifying entity set only when it participates in only one
identifying relationship and has few attributes.

**Note**: Don't link a [relational schema](202302101331.md) to a weak entity if
there's no descriptive attribute attached to it as it is deemed
[redundant](202206171004.md). Therefore, upon designing an [E-R diagram](202302101334.md),
there's no need to present it in a relational database.
