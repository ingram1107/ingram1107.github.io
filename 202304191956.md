# Entity Set

Entity set is a [Set](202204281446.md) of [Entities](202304191954.md) of the
same type that share the same properties. The actual collection or instances of
entities, especially in [Database-Management System (DBMS)](202302101137.md),
are called an extension.

If all entities in an entity set participate in at least one [Relationship Set](202304200933.md),
then this can be called as a *total participation*. In contrast, if only some of
them are, then it is a *partial participation*.

We say that an entity set is a **weak entity set** if it doesn't have sufficient
[Attributes](202304200943.md) to form a [primary key](202302101331.md) to
uniquely identify the entities it contained. This means it relies on foreign key
to another entity, usually one or more **strong entity sets** (that have a
primary key). We use a set of attributes, called *discriminator* or partial key,
to distinguish the entities in a weak entity set. In mathematical sense,
$\text{primary key in weak entity set} = \text{primary key of identifying sets} + \text{discriminator}$.
This creates a dependency to the entity set that the weak entity set referring
to, and we call this [Relationship](202304192107.md) as identifying relationship
(typically many entities in weak entity set to one entity in strong entity set)
and the entity set referred by it as identifying or owner entity set. There will
be no descriptive attributes to the identifying relationship as it is likely to
be part of the weak entity set. Other than identifying relationship, weak entity
set is free of participating on other relationships and even as an identifying
relationship to another weak entity set.

**Note**: A weak entity set may be converted to a multivalued composite
attribute in the identifying entity set only when it participates in only one
identifying relationship and has few attributes.
