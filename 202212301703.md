# Cyclic Code Decoder

Constructing a #[Cyclic Code](202212192231.md) Decoder is similar to what we
have done in #[Cyclic Code Encoder](202212301636.md), except that the modulo-2
adder should be added to the **left** of the flip-flop instead of to the right,
and the input will be coming from the left to the right. The decoder could be
used in [syndrome calculation](202211162040.md)#.
