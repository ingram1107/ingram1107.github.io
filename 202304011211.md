# Unified Modelling Language (UML)

UML is a standard language for specificying, visualising, constructing, and
documenting the artefacts of #software systems, business modelling, and other
non-software systems which uses [OOP concept](202202041514.md) and is
independent of any #programming-language.

There are three categories of diagrams defined by UML:
- [UML Structural Diagram](202304011215.md)
- [UML Behavioural Diagram](202304011216.md)
- [UML Interaction Diagram](202304011217.md)

**Note**: After constructing a UML diagram, maybe we can use [Rubber Ducking](202207242248.md)
to validate its adherence to the business logic and seem whether it is logical.
