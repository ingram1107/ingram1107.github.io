# Global Positioning System (GPS)

GPS is the only fully functional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). It
uses at least 32 medium orbit satellites that transmit microwave signals to
enable GPS receivers to determine location, speed, direction, and time.
Receiver have to pinpoint the satellites' location in order to calculate its
position via knowing code-phase arrival times. Four quantities have to be
determined, which are latitude, longitude, height, and GPS time ($\text{arrival
time} - \text{transmitted time}$).
