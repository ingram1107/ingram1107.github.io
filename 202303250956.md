# Architectural Constraint

Constraint represents a constant (always remain true) in an
[architectural design](202303242154.md). These constraints can be applied on
[value of properties](202303250953.md), topology, and design vocabulary.

With the use of [Audit Trail](202304302032.md) and following internal rules,
processes, and procedures, we could have a better understanding on how to define
a constraint.
