# Instruction Pipeline

A typical instruction pipeline execution stages proceed with decoding first,
then preparing parameter, and lastly the instruction execution.

Stall, that is the interruption on instruction flow, will happen when the next
instruction location is not correctly predicted, or it takes too long to load
the next instruction (reading from memory). This can only be improved in branch
prediction.

The stall will become too costly if the pipeline is long as it will take a while
for the processor to get up to speed again.
