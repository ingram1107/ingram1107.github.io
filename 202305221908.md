# Coordination Mechanism

The following shows the examples of coordination mechanism:
- verbal and non-verbal communication (talk is central where non-verbal cues are
  used to emphasise and as substitute)
- schedules, rules, and conventions
- shared external representations (like checklists, tables, to-do lists)

**Note**: Staying from too much or too little system control on coordination as
the former will make the users rebel and the latter will make the collaboration
breaks down.

**Note**: Notification system that provides information about shared objects and
progress of collaborative tasks can be used for coordination purpose.
