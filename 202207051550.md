# Ethernet

Ethernet is a system that links the computers within a local area which consists
of #hardware (e.g. network interface card), software, and cabling ([Twisted Pair Cable](202210111832.md)
or coaxial cable) for the connections. Computers are attached to the Ethernet
with a shared #[data link](202206131651.md). It supports network speed ranging
from 10Mbps to 10Gbps. It is the most dominated protocol for the #[Local-Area Network (LAN)](202207051554.md)
communication.

Ethernet uses the [Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detect Protocol (CSMA/CD)](202207051755.md)#
to resolve collisions. Further reduction of the occurrence of the collision can
be done by dividing the network into [Collision Domain](202207051805.md)#.

It uses transparent [bridging](202207051851.md)# where forwarding decisions
happen one hop (or network segment) at a time.

Using [Switch](202207051907.md)# can greatly improve the network throughput
(bandwidth) by configure the port connected to the Ethernet as *full duplex*
(two-way communications, simultaneously receive incoming traffic and transmit
traffic).
