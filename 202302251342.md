# Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3)

POP3 is an [Application Layer](202206131856.md) [Protocol](202209302229.md)
designed for simple local mail access. It established a [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)
connection from the user agent (client) to mail server on the
[port](202206151841.md) 110, then goes through three phases:
[Authorisation](202210221159.md) (with username and password), transaction (mail
operations), and update (status of the mail messages). POP3 deploys the
download-and-delete policy on mail access, meaning if a user agent retrieve the
mail from the server, the mail will be deleted from the server and not available
for reread from other user agent if any.
