# Zypper

Zypper is the package management system used by [openSUSE](202205192257.md) with
the combination of [RPM](202409131538.md) for lower-level package management. It
provides commands such as `refresh` (refreshing package metadata), `search` or
`se`, `install` or `in`, `update`, `remove` or `rm`, `list-updates`, `info`, and
`repos`.

**Note**: Zypper can directly install RPM packages without the help of RPM.

`zypper se -i {saerch-string}` lists all installed packages if no other
arguments are given. If search string is specified, then packages that related
to that are shown. `zypper se -u` on the other hand shows non-installed
packages. `zypper se --provides` shows the package ownership of the files.

Like [YUM](202409131546.md) and [DNF](202409131555.md), Zypper also provides the
means to manage repositories with the commands `modifyrepo`, `addrepo {url}
{aliasS}`, and `removerepo {alias}`. `modifyrepo` has options for enabling the
repository (`-e`), disable the repository (`-d`), disable automatic refresh
feature of a repository (`-F`), and enable automatic refresh feature with `-f`.
By default, a newly added repository will be enabled immediately, but wouldn't
have automatic updates enabled (enable with `-f`).
