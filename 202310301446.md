# Foldseek

Foldseek describes [Amino Acid](202308082207.md) backbone of the proteins as
sequence over structural alphabet and uses [Sequence Alignment](202308161006.md).
It decreases the computation times by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude with 86%, 88%,
and 133% of sensitivities of Dali, TM-align, and CE.
