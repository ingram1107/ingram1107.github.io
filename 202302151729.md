# Abduction

Although [converse error](202206172105.md) and [inverse error](202206172146.md)
are [Logical Fallacies](202206172053.md), a form of converse error called
Abduction can be useful on approximating the probability. Let say a doctor know
that for all $x$, if $x4 has pneumonia, then $x$ has a fever and chills, coughs
deeply, and feels exhausted and miserable. And he meets John, who has fever and
chills, coughs deeply, and feels exhausted and miserable. The doctor can
conclude that a diagnosis of pneumonia is a strong possibility, even if it is
not certain.
