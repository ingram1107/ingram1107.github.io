# HashiCorp Terraform

Terraform is an #[open source](202110161031.md) automation tool used for
#[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](202206061419.md) which is available in multiple
platforms such as Windows, Apple and [Linux](202204081225.md). It can manage
on-premise server, [Cloud Computing](202210012158.md)# (AWS, Azure, Google Could
Platform), #[Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md) (VMWare),
[Version Control System (VCS)](202208131616.md) and protocol (HTTP, TLS,
[Domain Name Server (DNS)](202209300947.md))
using [Terraform Providers](202206072140.md)# available in
[Terraform Registry](202206072143.md)#.

Terraform uses [HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)](202206061645.md)# as its
configuration language and utilises its declarative nature to set up
infrastructure accordingly.

A usual Terraform workflow should start with initialising the project and
identify the [Terraform Providers](202206072140.md)# to be used for the target
environment using the command `terraform init` (**initialise phase**). Then,
dry-run or test blueprint for each target environment by laying out the action
that will be carried out with the command `terraform plan` (**planning phase**).
Finally, apply the blueprint and make necessary changes for the target
environment accordingly by running `terraform apply` (**apply phase**). Both
`terraform plan` and `terraform apply` change the *state* of Terraform. The
state of the resources is recorded in the file `terraform.tfstate`. If there is
a disparity between current environment and the blueprint such as
[missing plugins](202206072154.md)#, Terraform will fix it in order to adhere to
the specified requirements. Otherwise, one could simply run `terraform refresh`
to synchronise the state of Terraform and the underlying infrastructure. We can
import resources that is created manually or providers that is outside
[Terraform Registry](202206072143.md)# (from other #[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](202206061419.md)
tools).

**Note**: You could modify the state using `terrafrom state`. However, it is for
advanced usage so use it with care. You can inspect the state of a resource
using `terraform state {provider}.{resource}` syntax.

One don't need to run the mentioned two commands in order to find out
configuration errors within the project, `terraform validate` should be enough
to do the job. Be aware that the command can't access any *remote service* such
as remote state and provider APIs, so the values might not be checked. The
command `terraform show` can be used to show the resource's details defined in
the file. Pass the option `-json` if you want them to be in JSON format. We can
inspect all the [output variables](202206151015.md)# or only the specific one,
if there's any, by calling the command `terraform output`. To show the current
required providers for the project, run `terraform providers`, and we can export
these providers into another directory using the subcommand `mirrors`.

We can destroy a Terraform infrastructure with the command `terraform destroy`.

All configuration and execution plans, and dependencies could be visualised
using the command `terraform graph`. Since its output is in Graphviz format, you
can pipe it to the software `dot` as follows.

```sh
terraform graph | dot -Tsvg terraform.svg
```

`terraform fmt` could be run in order to format all HCL files in the project
directory.

Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise provide a Web UI that centralised all
Terraform components which ease the management.
