# Method of Generalising from the Generic Particular

Method of generalising from the generic particular is a [Mathematical Proof Methods](202302281137.md)
that trying to prove a [Universal Statement](202204281245.md). It is an
alternative to *method of exhaustion* which trying to prove all instances in the
statement are true which can be impossible due to the infinite size of the
domain. This is done by showing that every element of a [Set](202204281446.md)
satisfies a certain property, suppose $x$ is a *particular* (single quantity)
but *arbitrarily chosen* (generic) element of the set, and show that $x$
satisfies the property.
