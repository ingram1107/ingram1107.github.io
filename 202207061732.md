# Broadcast Domain

Broadcast Domain is a network segment where a device can receive all broadcast
messages from the members of the segment. It is usually segmented by
[Network Layer](202206131702.md)# [Network Device](202207051821.md)# (modern
#[Switch](202207051907.md) and #[Router](202207061800.md)).

It can come in handy when a device wants to query the network for an
[IP Address](202206281021.md)#, when a device is newly added to a network, or
when a change occurs in the network.
