# Broadcast Domain

Broadcast Domain is a network segment where a device can receive all broadcast messages from the members of the segment. It is usually segmented by [202206131702](202206131702.md)# [202207051821](202207051821.md)# (modern #[202207051907](202207051907.md) and #[202207061800](202207061800.md)).

It can come in handy when a device wants to query the network for an [202206281021](202206281021.md)#, when a device is newly added to a network, or when a change occurs in the network.
