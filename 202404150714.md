# System Initiation

A typical OS initialisation first disable interrupts when booting. After that,
it sets up interrupt vectors and stacks, and performs self-diagnostic tests on
#hardware. Later, OS will perform system initialisation to set necessary system
parameters in place. Finally, it will enable the interrupts.
