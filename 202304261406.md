# Windowing

Windowing is a [Flow Control](202209302245.md) method where the device sends
[ACK](202303141902.md) (without timeout) only when it has received enough
packets. The consensus about the size of window can be reached after the server
send back an ACK packet with the information of the window size that it can
achieve (usually after a packet has failed to be sent to the server).
Furthermore, it has an additional benefit of handling the edge case where the
sender could send too much, too fast which could overflow the receiver's buffer.
The timeout is typically larger than [Round-Trip Time (RTT)](202303292133.md) to
avoid unnecessary retransmissions of acknowledged packets so that there will be
no large amount of packets resides in the [pipeline](202303141909.md).
