# Go-Back-N (GBN) Protocol

GBN protocol is a kind of [Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Protocol](202303141902.md)
that defines a **window size** of $N$ which contains the maximum number of
slots for packets which are sent but not yet acknowledged or not yet sent. When
the window is full, the sender can either buffer the data or use synchronisation
mechanism such as [Semaphore](202201291602.md) with the upper
[layer](202206131632.md). On the sender side, if a timeout is reached, it
resents $n$ number of sent but not yet acknowledged packets. On the receiver
side, if the packet is not correct or not in order, then it resends the most
recently successfully received packet's acknowledgment (ACK) to the other end.

That being said, GBN protocol is not perfect when encountering large window size
and bandwidth delay. A single packet error can result in large retransmission of
the packets within the window (in the pipeline) which is wasteful and not
necessary. The solution is to use [Selective Repeat (SR) Protocol](202303211253.md).
