# Asynchronous I/O

Asynchronous I/O, also called signal-driven I/O as its reliance on
[Signal](202211022108.md), allows the process to tell the
[Kernel](202210062254.md) to notify it when the specified
[File Descriptor](202210172248.md) is ready for I/O operations.

A typical asynchronous I/O can be established. First, a process should build up
a [signal handler](202211022139.md) for `SIGIO` (could be really simple by
relying on global variable). Then, it set the process ID or the process group ID
with the command `F_SETDOWN` from `fcntl()` [Unix System Call](202210062303.md).
Finally, enable the asynchronous I/O by calling `fcntl()` with the command
`F_SETFL` and pass the argument `O_ASYNC`.
