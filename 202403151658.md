# Direct Memory Access (DMA)

DMA allows I/O devices to store and receive data in [RAM](202403132022.md)
without CPU intervention (via interrupt). It directly competes with RAM in front
side bus's bandwidth.

Its working mechanism is based on a CPU-setup system memory based buffer in
which the CPU also provides the corresponding I/O adapter with descriptor. Upon
the descriptor's creation, as a circular ring, CPU writes to the [Memory-Mapped I/O](202404061058.md)
register of the adapter to notify its presence. The descriptor contains the
pointer to the buffer that can be referenced by the adapter for read and/or
write operations. The I/O adapter will update the buffer's status to the CPU
aperiodically.
