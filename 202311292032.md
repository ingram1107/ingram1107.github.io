# AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations allows centralised management on multiple AWS accounts into an
organisation. This includes centralised service access policies (SCP), automated
account creation and management using APIs, and consolidated billing across
multiple accounts. The accounts are organised into several organisational units
(OU), and the policies are attached to the OU or individual accounts. The higher
the hierarchy of OU in the organisation diagram, the more general its
responsibilities and role should be.

Unlike [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](202312131707.md), AWS
Organizations is more focus on simplify the access management across multiple
accounts instead of setting policies to individual users. Despite this, it
offers integration with the IAM. It also offers *service control policies*
(SCPs), defined in JSON, where we can specify the maximum permissions that the
member accounts in the organisation can have. Such restriction can't be
overridden by the administrators of those member accounts. Therefore, it acts as
guidelines for AWS accounts so that they stay within the access control policies
defined by the corporate.

It can be managed from AWS Management Console, AWS CLI tools, AWS SDKs, or AWS
Organizations HTTPS Query API.
