# AWS Organizations

AWS Organizations allows centralised management on multiple AWS accounts into an
organisation. This includes centralised service access policies (SCP), automated
account creation and management using APIs, and consolidated billing across
multiple accounts. The accounts are organised into several organisational units
(OU), and the policies are attached to the OU or individual accounts. The higher
the hierarchy of OU in the organisation diagram, the more general its
responsibilities and role should be.

Unlike AWS IAM, AWS Organizations is more focus on simplify the access
management across multiple accounts instead of setting policies to individual
users.

It can be managed from AWS Management Console, AWS CLI tools, AWS SDKs, or AWS
Organizations HTTPS Query API.
