# Virtual-Circuit Network

Virtual Circuit network is a virtual connection between a source and destination
host that requires handshake. All [Router](202207061800.md) along the path
between the source and destination will be assigned the VC identifier (VC ID)
for each link, which is added to the packet that is to be transferred. In
virtual circuit network, it forwards packets from the input interface to the
output link according to the VC ID revealed in the packet's header. The packet's
header's VC ID will constantly change, get from the [forwarding table](202210112056.md),
while it travels along the path. Furthermore, every router maintains the state
information for ongoing connections along the source-to-destination path, that
is new connection entry must be added to the router's forwarding table every
time a connection is established, and be removed when it is released. Even if
there is no VC ID translation, the routers will still maintain such information.
This enables routers to track behaviour of each individual sender such as their
average transmission rate and take source-specific [Network Congestion Control](202304261436.md)
like explicitly signalling to reduce rate.

The lifetime of a virtual-circuit network consists of setup, data transfer, and
teardown. During the setup, the sending transport layer specifies the need of
the receiver's address, and waits for the network layer to set up the virtual
circuit. It then determines the path and VC ID for each link along the path.
Finally, it also adds an entry in forwarding table in each router. The network
layer may reserve resources along the path of the VC. Teardown can be initiated
by either sender or receiver using signalling messages via signalling protocols.
The network layer will then inform and update the forwarding table in all
routers involved.

**Note**: Signalling messages also could be pass between routers to modify the
connection state in the forwarding table.

The advantages of using virtual-circuit network is that replacing the VC ID from
link to link reduces the length of the VC field and permits different VC ID at
each link which simplifies the network setup.

Examples of [Packet Switching](202207150848.md) technologies that use
virtual-circuit network are:
- [X.25](202303141358.md)
- [Frame Relay](202208291308.md)
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)
