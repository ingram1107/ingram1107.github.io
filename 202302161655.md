# Virtual-Circuit Network

Virtual Circuit VC is a virtual connection between a source and destination
host. All [Switch](202207051907.md) along the path between the source and
destination will be assigned the same VC identifier (VC ID), which is added to
the packet that is to be transferred. In virtual circuit network, it forwards
packets according to the VC ID revealed in the packet's header. Furthermore,
every switch maintains the state information for ongoing connections, that is
new connection entry must be added to the switch's translation table every time
a connection is established, and be removed when it is released.

Examples of [Packet Switching](202207150848.md) technologies that use
virtual-circuit network are:
- [X.25](202303141358.md)
- [Frame Relay](202208291308.md)
- [Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)](202209221012.md)
