# Function Points (FP) Estimation

Function points estimation is an indirect approach to [Estimation Decomposition Technique](202305140747.md).
It focuses on the domain values particularly values that related to system
functionality. However, it remains subjective and not necessarily able to match
the functionality. In FP estimation, the weight represents the average level of
complexity which could be simple, average, or complex. Based on the $S$ software
size calculated beforehand, which is the estimated count in FP estimation table,
we can find out the corresponding FP count for each domain value via $\text{FP
count} = \text{Estimated count} \times \text{Weight}$. After summing up all
domain values' FP count, we can find out the estimated FP with the following
formula:

$$
FP_{estimated} = \text{FP count total} \times (0.65 + 0.01 \times \sum{F_i})
$$

Where $F_i$ is the sum of all value adjustment factors.
