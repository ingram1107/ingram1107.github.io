# POSIX Advisory Lock

POSIX Advisory Lock is a lock that doesn't necessary forbid other process from
writting the file that is being locked. It is especially useful when working
with *cooperating processes*. It could be done with `flock()` [Unix System Call](202210062303.md)#,
imported from `sys/file.h`, with [File Descriptor](202210172248.md)# and
*specified operation* as parameters.

There are four operation flags could be used:
- `LOCK_SH` places a shared lock which could be owned by multiple processes
- `LOCK_EX` places an exclusive lock
- `LOCK_NB` imposes non-blocking policy on the lock when ORed with another lock
  flag
- `LOCK_UN` remove the current lock held by the process

An example use case is shown as follows:

```c
int fd = open("hello.txt", ...);

if (flock(fd, LOCK_SH) == -1) { // acquire a shared lock
  perror("lock");
}

// Do stuffs (criticial section)

if (flock(fd, LOCK_UN) == -1) { // relinguish the lock
  perror("lock");
}
```
