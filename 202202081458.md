# const_cast

`const_cast` is a safer version of C cast. It removes the constness or
#[volatileness](202202081526.md) of the variable and allows the change of value
for the variable at that time.

## Attention

- Do not change the value of the variable after const_cast. It will result in
  **undefined behaviour**
