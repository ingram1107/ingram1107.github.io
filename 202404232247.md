# Runtime Scheduling

In runtime scheduling, a label called **priority** is often attached to
[processes](202210062301.md), either in fix or dynamic fashion, for the
scheduler to make its decision based on it. The process with higher priority
usually get the resources first. [Interrupts](202404141448.md) may be initiated
to the process as a response to an event. Therefore, runtime scheduling requires
a complex mechanism for synchronisation and [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md).
