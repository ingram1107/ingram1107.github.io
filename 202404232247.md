# Runtime Scheduling

In runtime scheduling, a label called **priority** is often attached to
[processes](202210062301.md), either in [fix](202404232313.md) or
[dynamic](202404232317.md) fashion, for the scheduler to make its decision based
on it. The process with higher priority usually get the resources first.
[Interrupts](202404141448.md) may be initiated to the process as a response to
an event. Therefore, runtime scheduling requires a complex mechanism for
[Tasks or Threads Synchronisation](202404301021.md) and [Interprocess Communication (IPC)](202210262136.md).
