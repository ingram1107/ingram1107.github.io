# Firewall

Firewall is a mean of protection of a local system or network of systems from
network-based security threats when connecting to the WAN. It is usually acted
as a middle man between the premises network and the Internet with well
established [Access Control](202210022203.md) rules. The purpose of installing a
firewall is to establish a controlled link, protect the premises network from
Internet-based attacks, and provide a single choke point.

To design a workable Firewall, all incoming and outgoing traffics must pass
through it. This means that all accesses to the local network are blocked except
through the Firewall. Only authorised traffics, defined by the local security
policy, should be able to pass through it. Such Firewall should not be able to
be penetrable, thus a trusted system with a secure #operating-system should be
installed.

A Firewall could restrict access via *service control* (which Internet service
could be access, inbound or outbound), *direction control* (flow direction
allowed for a service), *user control* (which user can use which service), and
*behaviour control* (how a service could be used).

There are several types of Firewall:
- [Packet-Filtering Routers](202301221147.md)#
- [Application-Level Gateways](202301221202.md)#
- [Circuit-Level Gateways](202301221209.md)#

With combination of [Bastion Host](202301221214.md)#, we could configure a more
complex firewall system such as screened host firewall system with single- or
dual-homed bastion host and screened-subnet firewall system.
