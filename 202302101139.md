# Database

Database is a collection of interrelated data. **Instance** is a state of the
Database in a particular moment. **Schema** is the overall design of the
Database.

Database schema could be partitioned based on the [level of abstraction](202302101203.md).
Physical schema describes the database design in physical level whereas logical
schema describes the database design in logical level. Subschemas are a bunch of
view level schemas that describe different views of the database.

[Data Model](202302101219.md) describes the database in all three levels.

API such as Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) in #c and Java Database
Connectivity (JDBC) in #java can be utilised by application programmers to
interact with the databases.
