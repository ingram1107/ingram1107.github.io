# Audit Trail

We could see an audit trail as a combination of [Issue Identification](202305011153.md),
[formulation](202305011157.md), and [resolution](202305011201.md). It provides
an instrument for [validation](202304302152.md) and
[verification](202304302155.md) to enable assurance that it has been done
properly, and keeps all versions of them. To embed an audit trail, we have to:
1. Document system-level [Requirements](202303251303.md) into a
   [Database](202302101139.md).
2. Establish whether issues are present and, if so, resolve them.
3. Assign appropriate [validation](202304302152.md) and
   [Verification](202304302155.md) metrics
4. Establish guidelines for subcontractors.
5. Provide solid and clear [procurement](202304161643.md) instruments.
6. Track these activities from specifications through installation and
   operation.

Embedding audit trail as part of the normal #organisation procedures will help
us to realise the potential increasing benefits as a result of incorporating
these processes.
