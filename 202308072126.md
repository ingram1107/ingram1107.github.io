# Civilisation

Civilisation comes from the advancement of material conditions (pembangunan
fizikal) and cultural enrichment (pembangunan rohani). It is advice to have both
been developed in a balance way. In the study field (ilmu ketamadunan), we
develop the theories, basic concepts, characteristics, and nature about
civilisations conceptually, theoretically, and abstractly. In this manner, it
ascends the restrains of time (batasan zaman) in order to understand the nature
of civilisations. In contrast, if we study from the historical aspect of the
civilisation, we refer to the civilisation's experience as a whole (its
achievement, and rise and fall), and this of course is limited by its present of
time.
