# Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the use of computing resources, either #hardware or
#software, to provide service over a network, thus no compatibility issue and
could be scale in demand of the customer. Most of the cloud service providers
are utilising [Data Center](202210012205.md)#. Although on-premises cloud
(private cloud, build by the company itself) is still an option, it is often
scales badly to meet the business [Requirement](202303251303.md). Regardless,
[bandwidth](202304191208.md), [Latency](202304111955.md), and downtime are
concerns for its performance, and its #security is based on adjacent users from
different organisation ([attacker](202301021642.md) will attack the weakest
point on the link) since most cloud providers will put them on the same
hardware.

That being said, it might not be ideal when considering the cost of migrating
existing data or those resided from other cloud provider. Additionally, there
are some applications that are simply not suited for cloud computing since the
usage requires extensive requirement.

There are several forms of cloud computing available to the customers to choose
with variety of freedom over the underlying computing structure:
- [Software as a Service (SaaS)](202304161334.md)
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Desktop as a Service (DaaS)
- Managed Software as a Service (MSaaS)
- Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)
- Data Center as a Service (DCaaS)
- Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS)
- Information Technology Management as a Service (ITMaaS)

Examples of cloud services are:
- Amazon's Elastic Computing (EC2)
- AT&T Synaptic Cloud
- Cisco's Unified Computing Service (UCS)
- Google Cloud
- HP CloudSystem
- IBM Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle Cloud
- OpenStack
- Linode's Cloud
