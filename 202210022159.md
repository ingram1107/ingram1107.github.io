# Non-Repudiation

Non-Repudiation is a characteristic where both party, usually a sender and a
receiver from #networking perspective, can't deny the validity of a message. Any
third parties can prove that the message is sent by that particular sender, and
is received by that particular receiver, which could prevent forgery. It
utilises [Digital Signature](202210040909.md)#, [Data Integrity](202210022154.md)#,
and [Notarisation](202210040918.md)#. Audit trails or sever logs can certainly
help in enforcing non-repudiation.
