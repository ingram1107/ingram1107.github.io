# Fog Computing

In fog computing, [IoT](202408142322.md) devices' data can be pre-processed for
immediate use in the fog located at the network edge. It is especially prominent
in smart home implementation since [Cloud Computing](202210012158.md) can take
up too much [Latency](202304111955.md).

Fog computing keep sensitive data from being transported beyond the edge, which
addresses the security concern often raised in cloud services.
