# Ring Network

Ring network is a [Network Topology](202304211303.md) where the
[Network Devices](202207051821.md) connected in a ring where the data flow in
one direction. Thus, if one of the device being brought down by whatever reason,
the whole network will be brought down too, affecting the network [Availability](202210022157.md).
To overcome this, we can adopt a dual-ring network topology that flows in
opposite directions.
