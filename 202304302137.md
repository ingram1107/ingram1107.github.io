# Structural Perspective QA

Structural perspective QA, aka verification testing, is one of the [Quality Assurance (QA)](202304302045.md)
approaches which tests the micro-level details (internal structure) of the
[System](202303242148.md) that treat system as a [White Box](202305202159.md).
This could include #hardware processor input-output (I/O) lines, [throughput capacity](202304111957.md),
cycle time, coding particulars. There are other indicators such as system
reliability, [Availability](202210022157.md), maintainability, and
interoperability or [usability](202303242139.md).
