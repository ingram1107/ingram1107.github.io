# Quality Auditing

Quality auditing is a structured view of specific quality management activities,
that can help identify lessons learned and that could improve #performance on
current or future projects. For easier comprehension, treat it like comparing
with predetermined criteria in order to measure the overall project performance.
Quality audits could be done via schedule or randomly.
