# Cordless Network

Cordless network is a fixed [phone network](202303311239.md) that uses
unlicensed spectrum and is connected by a [Basic Service Set (BSS)](202304171335.md)
for #communication (cordless phone). For business uses, BSS may include a
miniature Private Branch Exchange (PBX). It has a rather low transmission power
(resulted in less than 100 m coverage) and inferior sound quality than
[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)](202304111937.md).

Several standards are available for cordless network:
- Cordless Telephone System 2 (CT-2, developed by European Telecommunications
  Standards Institute, ETSI)
- Digital Enhanced Cordless Technology (DECT)
- Personal Handyphone System (PHS)
