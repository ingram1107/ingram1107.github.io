# Issue Formulation

Issue formulation is a process examining the issue in detail and coming to an
understanding of the rationale behind the issue and formulating this
understanding into a series of pertinent (relevant) questions. It determines the
potential impact of the understanding to the [System Integration (SI)](202303242149.md)
project and establishes the level of risk related to problem resolution and also
in the event the issue is unable to be resolved.
