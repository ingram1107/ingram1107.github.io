# Router

Router is a #[Network Device](202207051821.md) operates at
[Network Layer](202206131702.md)# which forwards packets from source to destination
based on network layers protocols (reading the source and destination
[IP Address](202206281021.md)). It will communicate with other routers using
[Routing Protocol](202207061815.md)# (dynamic routing) or be manually edited by
network administrators (static routing) to maintain or update their
[Routing Table](202210112056.md)# that contain optimal routing paths. Of course
Router needs to be connected to a network to establish either dynamic routing or
static routing.

**Note**: Static routing can be a rather tedious networking administrative chore
which is prone to human error and doesn't really scale well.

We could access the Router console using either *console port*, Telnet or
[Secure Shell (SSH)](202205191908.md)#, or *auxiliary port* (not always
available). Console port is used to connect terminal or a personal computer that
runs terminal emulator software.

The physical structure of Router mainly consists of CPU, RAM, ROM, Flash, NVRAM
and interfaces or ports. RAM not only stores the [Routing Table](202210112056.md)#,
but also holds [Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)](202209301002.md) cache and
fast-switching cache, performs packet buffering, and provides temporary memory
for the running configuration file. NVRAM provides permanent storage for startup
configuration file. Various versions of #[Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)](202210012232.md)
are stored in Flash. ROM is where the power-on self test (POST) diagnostic
software and bootstrap program (boot up partial IOS) located.

#important

When the router first boots up, it will perform POST which executes diagnostics
from ROM on several components such as CPU, RAM, NVRAM etc. If there is no error
encountered during the diagnostics, then the bootstrap program will be loaded
into the RAM from ROM to locate IOS (usually located in Flash, but sometimes
utilises Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) if it can't find the operating
system) and load the operating system into RAM. After that, the bootstrap
program will try to load the startup configuration file stored in NVRAM, if any,
or TFTP server, if there's none, into RAM. Depending on the existence of the
startup configuration file, the IOS will either load it into RAM as
running-config file or enter Setup mode. User could choose to skip the Setup
mode, and a default running-config file will be created.

**Note**: If there is a problem on locating IOS image, then ROM will provide a
partial version of IOS. It will then help diagnose any problems and try to load
a complete version of IOS elsewhere.

**Note**: To avoid the delays of searching startup configuration file on TFTP
server, especially for the newly installed routers, disconnect all the WAN
interfaces until a startup configuration file is obtained.

Router consists of two types of interfaces: *[LAN](202207051554.md) interfaces*
and *[WAN](202207150833.md) interfaces*. LAN interfaces could be used to connect
Router to the LAN which is typically connected with an RJ-45 jack
([Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP)](202210111822.md)). For connecting Router
to [Switch](202207051907.md), we use a [Straight-Through Cable](202210111828.md).
In the case of Router to Router, we use a [Crossover Cable](202210111835.md).
For PC to Router, we will use [Roll-Over Cable](202210111839.md). LAN interface
could serve [Ethernet](202207051550.md)# and Fast Ethernet.

WAN interfaces are for external connection, that is router to external network.
It could serve different [Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) technologies
such as Serial, [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)
and [Frame Relay](202208291308.md).

Every interface or port belongs to a different network. This means that each
connected interface represents exactly one network. Although Router itself is a
complete entity, the network could only recognise its interfaces, which are
independent of the Router in logical perspective. Thus, the Router could be
referred in different [IP Address](202206281021.md) depending on which network
we are working on.

The process of forwarding the packet from its received port to the outgoing port
is called [switching](202207051907.md). Despite the naming, Router will
immediately drop the packet when it can't figure the destination in its routing
table maintained by itself. Otherwise, it will simply modify the destination
[Media Access Control Address (MAC)](202206151451.md) (the next-hop, can be another
Router or the final destination) in the packet without touching the
[IP Address](202206281021.md) which defines the final destination. Though the
primary forwarding decision will be based on the [Routing Table](202210112056.md)#
or routing information, assuming there is a mapping of [logical address](202206281021.md)
to its interface or port. If there is no path defined in the routing table to
where the packet should be forwarded to, Router will redirect it to a default
route if set (usually 0.0.0.0 in [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) and ::/0 in
[IPv6 Address](202206281129.md)), or simply discards it and sends
[Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)# Unreachable message
to the source. Additionally, we can divide a physical interface into at most
65,535 logical interfaces using the command `interface {interface-name}
{interface}.{subinterface}`. This is particularly useful in [Virtual LAN (VLAN)](202207061741.md)
routing. In [multicasting](202302201639.md), instead of sending duplicated
packets throughout the route, the router maintain a [multicast distribution tree](202302201821.md)
for forwarding decision.

It can be used to divide devices into [Broadcast Domain](202207061732.md)#.

It is one of the solution that could prevent #[Network Loop](202207081644.md).

Very large, very high-speed Router is often used in
#[packet-switched network](202207150848.md) and formed the backbone of the modern
Internet and global [Wide Area Network (WAN)](202207150833.md) connectivity
services. They are called the core routers. Those which sitting at the edges of
the network and providing WAN access to everyone else are usually called the
edge routers.

Both its [Ethernet](202207051550.md)# and serial interface (e.g., HWIC-2T) could
be assigned with #[IP Address](202206281021.md). Before adding the interface
modules to the router, the best practice is to turn off the router if it is
running and then switch it on after the installation. It is same in
[Cisco Packet Tracer](202210132259.md) environment.

There are routers integrate other network devices' functionalities such as
[Integrated Service Router (ISR)](202210012057.md)#.
