# POSIX Mandatory Lock

POSIX Mandatory Lock is a lock checked by Unix-like operating system to verify
that the operation such as `read` and `write` does not interfere with a lock
held by a process. It could be done by `lockf()` #[Unix System Call](202210062303.md)
(imported from `unistd.h`) which requires [File Descriptor](202210172248.md)#,
*function used*, and the *length* of the file. The locking starts from the
current byte position of the file, and if the length is positive, then it will
extend forward, otherwise it will extend backward. If length is 0, then the
entire file is locked.

There are four functions could be used on `lockf()`:
- `F_LOCK` sets an exclusive lock on the file, and blocks if it's already locked
  until the lock is released.
- `F_TLOCK` same as `F_LOCK` but doesn't block, and an error flag is set.
- `F_ULOCK` releases the lock.
- `F_TEST` tests whether the lock is set without setting a lock.

The flow of control could look like this:

```c
int fd = open("hello.txt", ...);

if (lockf(fd, F_LOCK, 0) == -1) {   // acquire lock
  perror("lock");
}

// Do stuffs (criticial section)

if (lockf(fd, F_ULOCK, 0) == -1) {  // relinguish lock
  perror("lock");
}
```
