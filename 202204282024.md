# Relation

Relation is a #[Set](202204281446.md) of #[Ordered Pair](202204281552.md) $(a,
b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ assuming that $A$ and $B$ are sets, which $a$
is related to $b$, denoted $a R b$. In this sense, $A$ is the domain of this
relation and $B$ is the co-domain. We could say that it is *a relation from A to
B*.

Let $A = \{0, 1, 2\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$, and let's say that element $a$ in
$A$ is related to element $b$ in $B$ if and only if $a < b$. This relation could
be expressed in a set as $\{(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)\}$.
The result of $A \times B$ is $\{(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3),
(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)\}$. It is not hard to see that it is a
[Subset](202204281535.md) of [Cartesian Product](202204281601.md)# of $A$ and
$B$ aka $A \times B$.

An arrow diagram could be drawn from a relation. The following diagram shows the
relation from $X$ to $Y$:

**Note**: The arrows are coming from *domain* to *co-domain* which illustrate
that $x$ in $X$ is related to $y$ in $Y$.

Relation could be a [Function](202204282055.md)# if it met the criteria.
