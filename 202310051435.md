# Beiyang Clique

Beiyang Clique was a group of armed generals and politicians with different
self-interests having their own army and territory guided by Confucian moral
system coupled with western technologies and political system (中體西用). Its
core political philosophy could be seen from the quote from Yuan Shikai:
discipline for their mind, and practice for their skill
(訓以固其心, 練以精其技). It was initially composed of feudal landowners, but
later advanced into capitalist class after the effect of World War I.

The history of the Beiyang Clique (北洋軍閥) could be divided into four phases:
First, Yuan ShiKai's (袁世凱) founded the basis of the Beiyang Army starting
from Xiaozhan training (小站練兵) to 1912 when he became the first president of
the Republic of China (中華民國). Second, from there on to the failure of the
restoration of monarchy absolutism in the republic by Yuan ShiKai (洪憲帝制) in
1916. The third phase could be subdivided into two smaller phases, starting from
the death of Yuan ShiKai to 1920 Zhili-Anhui War (直皖戰爭), and ending from the
rose of power of Zhili Clique (during this period, two Zhili-Fengtian War,
直奉戰爭, broke out) until the July 1926 Northern Expedition (北伐). The last
phase, started from the expedition and ended in the Northeast Flag Replacement
(東北易幟) by Zhang XueLiang (張學良).
