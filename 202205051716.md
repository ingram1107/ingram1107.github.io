# Xorg

Xorg is a [free](202110161030.md) and [open source](202110161031.md) implementation
of #[202205051624](202205051624.md). It is a fork of [202205051707](202205051707.md). The configuration file
for it is `xorg.conf`.

Xorg stores the [202205051943](202205051943.md)# in either `/usr/share/fonts` or
`/usr/share/X11/fonts`.

`xinit` provide a script call [202205192252](202205192252.md)# which will launch Xorg server manually.

## Configuration

There are several sections such as `InputDevice` ([202205051829](202205051829.md)# and
keyboard), `Screen`, `Monitor`, `Module`, `Device` ([202205051831](202205051831.md)) and
`SeverLayout` (can include multiple `Screen`) could be configured. The following
example shows a configuration for keyboard:

```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "system-keyboard"
        MatchIsKeyboard "on"
        Option "XkbLayout" "us,epo,fr,de"
        Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps"
EndSection
```

**Note**: Modules could be enabled or disabled in the section `Module` by adding
it in or removing it out.
