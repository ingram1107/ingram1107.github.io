# Profile Network (PHD)

PHD is an [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](202309091335.md) with two
[Multilayer Percepton](202309091359.md) in cascade in which the first one
predicts the [Protein Secondary Structure](202309092041.md) based on
[Amino Acid](202308082207.md) frequency in multiple sequences and the second one
predicts the secondary structure from the sequences from the structure resulted
from the first network. It can achieve 74% accuracy.
