# Trade Union

Trade Union is an [organisation](202203131313.md)# that fight for workers' rights
under capitalism. Their sole purpose is to educate the working class about the
course of capitalist oppression and impose a limit of exploitation that
capitalists could be put on #[proletariat](202204212051.md). However, it does not
eliminate the wage labour or wage slavery, which is the essential form of
capitalist exploitation.

They have little say in a capitalist society other than voicing up on the
working conditions of the working class. They can't intervene the labour demand
accords to the state of production, the labour supply from proletarianisation of
middle class and natural reproduction of the proletariat class, and the
momentary degree of productivity of labour.

Due to this nature, trade unions often act against the advancement of technology
or [Capitalist Mode of Production](202205211156.md)# under capitalism which is
reactionary. They could also fall into the trap in aligning with the capitalists
in order to control commodities' prices and fix the scale of production. And
since they are under [capitalist state](202204202040.md)#, it renders them as
merely a defensive apparatus for proletariat especially during the capitalist
economy crisis. Therefore, they cannot be viewed as the main force on opposing
capitalism.

I think it is best to follow the practice of [Socialist Democracy](202204211120.md)#
within trade union.
