# Contract Types

There are several contract types stated below:
- **Fixed-price contract**: fixed total price for a complete product or service.
- **Cost-reimbursable contract**: fixed or percentage payment for direct or
  indirect costs (such as factory renting where it is not directly traceable to
  a single product but can't make it without the factory) which is not based on
  the delivery of a complete product or service, so client bear the most cost as
  the total cost is not known.
- **Time and material contract**: mixture of fixed-price and cost-reimbursable
  contracts where there is a fixed cost based on the actual material cost which
  doesn't give incentive for the seller to control cost and the customer bear
  medium risk.
- **Unit price contract**: pay a predetermined amount per unit of service.
