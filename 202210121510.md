# RC4

RC4 is a simple and fast, byte-oriented #[Stream Cipher](202209281240.md),
designed by Ron Rivest and owned by RSA DSI, which accepts variable key size. It
is widely adopted such as in #[SSL](202212052009.md)/TSL and Wireless
[Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)](202408122255.md). The key forms random
permutation of all 8-bit values and use that to collect input information
processed a byte at a time. It has been proved to be insecure and easily
breakable recently especially against [Analytic Attacks](202212172229.md).
