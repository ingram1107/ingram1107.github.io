# MySQL Specific Information

The `natural join` in [Structured Query Language (SQL)](202302231241.md) is
implemented through the `inner join` keyword by the MySQL implementation.

`describe` command applied on the table or [Entities](202304191954.md) could be
used to display the columns or [Attributes](202304200943.md) information of the
table.

`limit {n}` clause allows query like `delete` to specify the instruction to be
executed on the first $n$ rows of the table.
