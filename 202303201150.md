# Islamic Banking

Islamic banking treats investment on a business as partaking as a partner of the
business. This means that there is a share of profit, loss, and risk between the
banker and the business operator. Such participation is done through purchasing
the commodity from the business, and the profits are generated through the
exchange of goods and services in fixed price (negotiated through an agreement).
There is no credit system, and ambiguous and uncertain transaction (Gharar) used
as it is prohibited. If the business fail, the bank will simply hand over it to
a better management.

**Note**: Investment is prohibited for prohibited or haram industries.
