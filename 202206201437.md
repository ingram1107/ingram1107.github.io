# Environmental Testing

It is important to check the environment of the software that is going to reside
in. Thus, testing the external factors such as *memory*, *disk space*, *CPU
bandwidth*, *wall-clock time*, *disk bandwidth*, *network bandwidth*, *colour
palette* and *video resolution* should be done too according the
#[Test Driven Development (TDD)](202206201159.md) principle. This is to know the
expected environmental limitations that are going to impose on the program.

It is the best if there are means for the program to recover from the hardware
failure gracefully with nice error messages. If that is not possible for
whatever reason, at least try to preserve its state to prevent the loss of work
which could in turn affect the [usability of the software](202206201428.md).
