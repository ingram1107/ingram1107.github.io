# Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance Protocol (CSMA/CA)

CSMA/CA is a method adopted by [IEEE 802.11](202303292155.md) aimed to avoid
*collisions* instead of [detecting it](202207051755.md) at all during the data
transmission by multiple clients once they sense the idleness of the [wireless media](202302161842.md).
The devices will wait for a random amount of time before transmitting while
monitoring the medium with the exponential backoff #algorithm. Of course the
[Throughput](202304111957.md) is decreased, but it is compensated by fewer
retransmissions. To reserve a channel, transmitting and receiving nodes can
exchange control [frames](202206131651.md).
