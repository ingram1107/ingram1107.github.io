# Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Avoidance Protocol (CSMA/CA)

CSMA/CA is a method adopted by [IEEE 802.11](202303292155.md) aimed to avoid
*collisions* instead of [detecting it](202207051755.md) at all during the data
transmission by multiple clients once they sense the idleness of the [wireless media](202302161842.md).
The devices will wait for a random amount of time before transmitting while
monitoring the medium with the exponential backoff #algorithm. Of course the
[Throughput](202304111957.md) is decreased, but it is compensated by fewer
retransmissions. To reserve a channel, transmitting and receiving nodes can
exchange control [frames](202206131651.md).

The process goes like this: first, Request To Send (RTS) is sent to ask for
duration the receiver intends to hold the medium. The receiver sends out Clear
To Send (CTS) message with the necessary information. If any node hears CTR that
is near the receiver, it will refrain from transmitting. For nodes that heard
RTS otherwise are permitted to transmit messages to the receiver, although the
sender must wait for ACK message from the receiver to indicate that the latter
has successfully received the frame sent.
