# IPv4 Address

IPv4 Address is a *32-bit* #[IP Address](202206281021.md). The address is
separated into *four* 8-bit numbers (called *octet*) by dots. An example of an
IPv4 address: 192.160.3.18. The address 0.0.0.0, sometimes referred as
*quad zero*, means any IPv4 address.

IPv4 Address can be divided into two parts: network and host bits. Depending on
the [Address Classes](202206280922.md)#, the size of the network and host bits
can be varying, plus with the introduction of the
[Subnetting](202206280939.md)#, host bits can be quite small.

Although there are technologies such as [Network Address Translation (NAT)](202206281817.md)#
and [Port Address Translation (PAT)](202206281830.md)# trying to overcome the
limitation of IPv4 Address, the possibility of running out of public address
becomes greater than [Regional Internet Registry (RIR)](202206281137.md)# starts
facing the trouble of exhausted IPv4 Addresses in the 2010s due to the
introduction of personal digital assistant (PDA), cellphones, Internet of Things
(IoT) etc. The alternative is to switch over to [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md)#.

Translation from IPv4 to IPv6 is possible, however it not an easy work since
changing of the IP address means the changing in the checksum.

The size of an IPv4 datagram range from 20 to 65536 bytes, its average length is
1,500 bytes. Its structure is like the following:
1. Header, size range from 20 to 60 bytes
2. Data
3. VER, indicates the version of the IP used, 4 bits or half a byte of size
4. HLEN, indicates the length of the header, 4 bits or half a byte of size
5. DS, specifies the type of [Differentiated Service](202209301020.md)#, one
   byte of size
6. Total length, indicates the total length of the datagram, 2 bytes of size
7. Identification, used to identify the fragmented packet, 2 bytes of size
8. Flags, 3 bits of size, used in termination identification, if it is 0, then
   the entity just hits the last fragmented packet, otherwise it will be 1
9. Fragmentation offset, used to identify the order of the packet if
   fragmentation was done on the packet, 13 bits of size.
10. Time to live (TTL), specifies the lifetime of the packet, 1 byte of size
11. Protocol, specifies the protocol used, 1 byte of size
12. Header checksum, used for error controlling, 2 bytes of size
13. Source [IP Address](202206281021.md)#
14. Destination IP Address
15. Option (optional)

The following table shows the possible value of Protocol field to indicate which
[Protocol](202209302229.md)# is in used:

| Value | Protocol                                                      |
| ---   | ---                                                           |
| 1     | [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)](202209270927.md)#  |
| 2     | [Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)](202209271135.md)# |
| 6     | [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#       |
| 17    | [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)#              |
| 89    | [Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)](202211101623.md)#           |

**Note**: Refer to RFC1700 and RFC3232 for more Protocol bit's value.

The fragmentation of the packet will be reassembly just before, usually on the
end-system, passing to [Transport Layer](202206131837.md) as either TCP or UDP
as both of them accept only unfragmented segment.
