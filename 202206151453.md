# IPv4 Address

IPv4 Address is a *32-bit* #[IP Address](202206281021.md). The address is
separated into *four* 8-bit numbers (called *octet*) by dots. An example of an
IPv4 address: 192.160.3.18. The address 0.0.0.0, sometimes referred as
*quad zero*, means any IPv4 address.

IPv4 Address can be divided into two parts: network and host bits. Depending on
the [Address Classes](202206280922.md)#, the size of the network and host bits
can be varying, plus with the introduction of the
[Subnetting](202206280939.md)#, host bits can be quite small.

Although there are technologies such as [Network Address Translation (NAT)](202206281817.md)#
and [Port Address Translation (PAT)](202206281830.md)# trying to overcome the
limitation of IPv4 Address, the possibility of running out of public address
becomes greater as [Regional Internet Registry (RIR)](202206281137.md)# starts
facing the trouble of exhausted IPv4 Addresses in the 2010s due to the
introduction of personal digital assistant (PDA), cellphones, Internet of Things
(IoT) etc. The alternative is to switch over to [IPv6 Address](202206281129.md)#.

Translation from IPv4 to IPv6 is possible, however it not an easy work since
changing of the IP address means the changing in the checksum.
