# Disproof by Counterexample

To disprove the following [Universal Statement](202204281245.md):

$$
\forall x \in D, \text{ if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x)
$$

We can find a value of $x$ in $D$ for which the hypothesis $P(x)$ is true and
the conclusion $Q(x)$ is false. Such a $x$ is called **counterexample**. Notice
that we are trying to prove that the negation of the statement is true, that is:

$$
\exists x \in D \text{ such that } P(x) \text{ and not } Q(x)
$$

Counterexample can be found when in search of a [proof](202302281234.md), and
conversely, trying to find counterexample can result in realising that the
statement might be true.
