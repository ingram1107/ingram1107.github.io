# Substitution Cryptography

Substitution Cryptography is a #[cryptographic](202209281121.md) method that
encrypt a message by *replacing* every text with an alternate text based on
their natural or mathematical relationship between each other.

All followings #algorithm or devices utilise substitution in producing their
ciphertext:
