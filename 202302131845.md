# Trusted System

Trusted System is a technology that enhance the ability of a system to defend
against [Intruder](202301021642.md) and [Malware](202301031611.md). It protects
the data and resources based on the basis of multilevel security, meaning that
a subject at a higher level may not convey information to a subject at a lower
level unless that flow precisely reflects the will of an authorised user. Such
multilevel system must enforce no read up (can only read an object less or equal
security level) and no write down (can only write an object greater or equal
security level) policy.

A trusted system has three main properties: **complete mediation** (enforce
rules on every access), **isolation** (protected from unauthorised
modification), and **verifiability** (mathematically provable).

It provides protection against [Trojan Horse](202301031617.md) attack as the
security polity take precedence over the access control list.

Example of trusted system:
