# AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

AWS KMS enables the creation and management of [encryption key](202209012213.md),
the control of the use of encryption across a wide range of AWS services and
client's applications. It integrates with AWS CloudTrail to provide logs of all
key usage. Customer master keys (CMKs) are used to control access to data
encryption keys that encrypt and decrypt your data.
