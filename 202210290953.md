# Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)

SNR is a measure to compare the level of a desired signal to the level of
background noise. It is defined as:

$$
SNR = \frac{P_{\text{signal}}}{P_{\text{noise}}}
$$

Where:
- $P$ is the average power

It can also be expressed in decibels (dB):

$$
SNR_{dB} = 10 \log_{10} (SNR)
$$
