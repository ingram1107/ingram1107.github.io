# Rubber Ducking

Let's say you are [debugging](202203131236.md)# a program and found a bug or a
problem. Some might just keep their mouth shut and suffer in their own terms.
Instead, [Hunt et al.](lit/@Hunt1999.md) suggests for a companion! You can talk
about the detail of the bug or problem to a literal rubber duck (if you don't
have a friend, which is relatable), a colleague, boss, or anyone who is willing
to listen to you. Their role is to nod, quack, or simply making an agreeing
sound, it doesn't matter. By this way, you could organise and evaluate your
thoughts more thoroughly and makes finding the solution easier. So grab a rubber
duck, and take it to your workplace!
