# Euler Path

Euler Path, unlike [202205101149](202205101149.md), doesn't need to be a cycle by itself. As
long as all edges in the #[202204112129](202204112129.md) are visited exactly once, the graph
is an Euler Path. Like [202205101149](202205101149.md), the graph needs to be connected. In the
graph, there must be exactly **two vertices** that has an **odd number** of
edges.

A graph could be determined as an Euler Path by using #[202205021959](202205021959.md). This
will result in a [linear runtime complexity](202201171844.md).
