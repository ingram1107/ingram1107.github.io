# Proof by Division into Cases

Proof by Division into Cases is a valid form of #[Argument](202205062050.md). As
the name suggests, the proof can be done if we **exhausted** all possible cases
and all of them come up with the same [Mathematical Statement](202204281244.md).
This will be shown below:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \lor q \\
&p \rightarrow r \\
&q \rightarrow r \\
\therefore \ &r
\end{align}
$$

To form a [Mathematical Proof](202302281137.md) for a [Mathematical Statement](202204281244.md)
of the form "If $A_1$ or $A_2$ or $\ldots$ or $A_n$, then $C$", we have to proof
all the $A$s to show that regardless of the cases, $C$ is always true.
