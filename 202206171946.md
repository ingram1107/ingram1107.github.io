# Proof by Division into Cases

Proof by Division into Cases is a valid form of #[202205062050](202205062050.md). As the name suggests, the proof can be done if we **exhausted** all possible cases and all of them come up with the same [202204281244](202204281244.md). This will be shown below:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \lor q \\
&p \rightarrow r \\
&q \rightarrow r \\
\therefore \ &r
\end{align}
$$
