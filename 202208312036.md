# Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

DSL is a #[Broadband](202208311155.md) technology that provides high-speed Internet
via existing telephone cabling similar to
[Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md). It is generally
referred to as xDSL due to variety of existing flavours of DSL including
*Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)* and *Symmetric DSL (SDSL)*. The former offers faster
download speeds than upload speeds and is usually subscribed by casual Internet
users. The latter offers equal bandwidth in both directions, which is preferred
in commercial settings.

Either way, DSL is distance sensitive due to its inability to amplify the
signals and converted to other medium. It can reach a maximum distance of around
5.5 km.

Since human speech occupies frequencies of roughly 4kHz and the copper wires are
capable of carrying 1 to 2MHz, it is possible to crave out a portion of it for
the high-speed Internet connection provision. For upstream data, it will use up
around 26 to 160kHz, whereas the downstream data will use up around 240 to
1500kHz. However, due to the nature of twisted-pair wires used by the telephone
line, it is required by DSL to have specialised equipments such as **low-pass
filters (LPF)** and **DSL access multiplexers (DSLAM)** to prevent interference
between voice and data due to high frequencies. LPF is typically placed on all
phone jacks that are not used by a computer in order to prevent interference.
DSLAM functions as an aggregator for signals and acts as the access point to the
Internet.
