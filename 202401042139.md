# AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

AWS VPC gives control to the user of the virtual networking resources, which
includes the range of the [IP Address](202206281021.md),
[Subnetting](202206280939.md) (subnet is belonged to a single [availability zone](202312011406.md)),
and [routing tables](202210112056.md) and network gateways #configuration. This
means that we have the control whether the subnet can be accessed from the
outside world. VPC provides multiple layers of #security mechanism, such as
*security groups* and *[network access control list](202302190738.md)*.

**Note**: The IPv4 CIDR block size have to be between /16 (the largest) and /28
(the smallest).

**Note**: Other than [the first and last network addresses](202401042152.md),
are being reserved, the second network address is used for internal
communication, the third network address is used for [Domain Name System (DNS)](202209300947.md)
resolution, and the forth network address is reserved for future expansion. So,
a total of five network addresses are reserved by AWS.

**Note**: Elastic IP address basically means static IP address that will stay
beyond the instance lifetime.

We can place an *internet gateway* to provide a target in order to establish a
connection to the Internet and perform [Network Address Translation (NAT)](202206281817.md).
All non-local traffic must be set to be sent to the [Default Route](202211060845.md)
for it to travel across the internet in order to reach the destination. In
contrast, if we don't want the outside world to have access to the instance but
still need to retain its connection to the Internet, we can implement a *NAT
gateway* in a public subnet. This gateway must have an elastic IP address
associates with it and direct the route accessing Internet resources from the
private subnets. VPC also allows *peering connection* where two VPC can
communicate with each other, in the restriction of non-overlapping IP address
range. To connect to remote network such as corporate private network, attach a
*virtual gateway* to the VPC, then define the configuration of the
[VPN](202207150909.md) device or customer gateway. After that, we have to create
a route table to point corporate traffic to the VPN gateway while updating the
security groups, then establish an *AWS Site-to-site VPN* connection, and
configure routing. If the connection between the corporate data centre and AWS
Region is too far away, AWS Direct Connect is a better option.

**Note**: Peering connection doesn't allow [transitive](202206102258.md)
connection.

AWS VPC introduces VPC sharing, in which the VPC owner can share their subnets
with other AWS accounts in the same [organisation](202311292032.md). These
participants may create, modify, and delete their application resources within
the subnet that are shared with them, but don't have the same privileges for
those that are not. The participants still retain their reference to the
security group IDs of each other. Some components can be reused, thus saving up
costs.

**Note**: As VPC connectivity complexity grows, we may utilise the AWS Transit
Gateway to simplify the network topology.

To control inbound and outbound traffics within the instance level and the
subnet level (acting like a [Firewall](202301211140.md)), AWS VPC provides
security group mechanism for instances and [Access Control List (ACL)](202302190738.md)
mechanism for subnets. By default, security group allows only outbound traffic
for the traffic, and it's stateful, meaning state information is kept even after
a request is processed. Only **allow rules** can be specified, and all of them
are evaluated before the decision. A default ACL is associated with a subnet,
which allows all inbound and outbound traffics, if there is none specified, and
the subnet must have an ACL to begin with. Unlike security group, we can set
deny rules just like what we did in a [Router](202207061800.md). ACL is
stateless in a way that no information about a request is maintained after a
request is processed. The rule with the lowest number is evaluated first in ACL.
