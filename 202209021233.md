# Fibre-Optic Cable

Fibre-Optic Cable or *Optical-Fibre Cable* is a medium to carry data
transmission in the form of light pulses, which is made by a flexible,
transparent fibre made from drawing glass or plastic. It is usually used for
#[Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)](202209021228.md) connection. Basically, there
are two types of Fibre-Optic Cable: [multimode](202209021240.md)# and
[single-mode](202209021249.md).

Although it still faces possible degradation as the light travel down in the
fibre, the deterioration is usually less than its copper counterpart. There are
primarily four form of deterioration for the light pulse:
[attenuation](202209021302.md)#, [dispersion and non-linearities](202209021304.md)#,
[chromatic distortion](202209021310.md)#, and
[polarisation or mode distortion](202209021313.md)#.

There are multiple protocols available to be used in the optical networks. The
following shows numerous of them:
- [Optical Ethernet](202209021741.md)#
- [Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing (CWDM)](202209021746.md)#
- [Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)](202209021754.md)#
- [Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)](202209021758.md)#
- [Dynamic Packet Transport (DPT)](202209031542.md)#
