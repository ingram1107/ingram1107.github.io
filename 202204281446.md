# Set

Set is a collection of elements where their *order* and *recurrence* does not
matter. It could be specified using either [202204281704](202204281704.md)# or
[202204281700](202204281700.md)#. Due to the properties of set, the set $\{a, b, c\}$ is same
with $\{b, a, c\}$ and $\{a, a, b, c, c, c\}$, which could be denoted as $\{a,
b, c\} \equiv \{b, a, c\} \equiv \{a, a, b, c, c, c\}$.

**Note**: There is a fundamental difference between an element $e$ and a set
that contains only that element $\{e\}$. ($e \not = \{e\}$)

If there are too many numbers to express, we can abbreviate them using
*ellipsis* (read "and so forth") as $\{1,2,3 \cdots 100\}$. There are some
[202204281506](202204281506.md)# that have their own special symbols.

From the set $S$, we could see that element $a$ is an element of $S$. This could
be expressed using $a \in S$. Let's say we have an element $d$, but we know that
$d$ is not an element of $S$, we can denote it as $d \not \in S$.

## Relations

Sets can have various relations with each other. See the following:
