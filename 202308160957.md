# Homologous

Two organisms could be said homologous if they can be derived from a common
ancestor. There are two types of homologous relationship:
- [Paralogs](202308160959.md)
- [Orthologs](202308161000.md)

The relatedness of two [proteins](202308082207.md) at [sequence level](202308161006.md)
indicates that they are homologous and may have common functions.
