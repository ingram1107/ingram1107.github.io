# Client-Agent-Server Model

Client-agent-server model splits computation responsibility into two main units:
client-agent for optimising for mobile environment and agent-server for
traditional (non-[mobile](202303292141.md)) design. With this model, an
application server can support both fixed network clients and mobile clients.

Upon encountering disconnection, clients will submit requests to the agent, and
from there, retrieve response from the agent upon reconnection. Agent can employ
optimisation and transformation techniques to the to-be-transmit data based on
its type of data, type of devices, and/or application-specific requirements.

Examples of the implementation of this model:
- [Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)](202405192127.md)
