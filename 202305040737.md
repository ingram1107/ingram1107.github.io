# Constraint-based Routing LDP (CR-LDP)

Constraint-based Routing LDP (CR-LDP) is an extension of [Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)](202304261308.md)
used to set up a [Label-Switched Path (LSP)](202305032308.md) that comply to the
[Quality of Service (QoS)](202209282057.md) or [Class of Service (CoS)](202305030823.md)
requirements in [Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)](202207150852.md) network.
It concerns on network parameters like link characteristics
([bandwidth](202304191208.md), [delay](202304111955.md)), hop count, and QoS.
However, it adds more complexity to routing calculations despite being able to
select a less loaded path.
