# Architectural Component

Component represents the primary computational element and data store of a
[System](202303242148.md) in [System Architecture](202303242154.md). Examples
are clients, servers, filters, objects, [blackboard](202207041156.md), and
[Database](202302101139.md). In [Architecture Description Language (ADL)](202303242159.md),
it might have multiple interfaces, each defines a point of [interaction](202303250943.md)
between a component and its environment.
