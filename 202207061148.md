# Ethernet Hub

Ethernet Hub is a #[202207051821](202207051821.md) operates at [202206131647](202206131647.md)# which enable devices to be plugged in or out without disturbing the #[202207051550](202207051550.md) network. Its ports also function as a [202207051832](202207051832.md). Since it doesn't have the information of the network topology, it will simply propagate the received package to every other port, which raises security concerns and wastes bandwidth.
