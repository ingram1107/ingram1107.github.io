# Git HEAD

Git HEAD is pointing to the current working commit. One could move the HEAD
along the commit history in the repository without restrictions. We could move
the HEAD to specific position by using `checkout {commit}` either by specifying
the [branch name](202204261226.md), tag, individual commit or by using
[202205251604](202205251604.md)#.
