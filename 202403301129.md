# Silicon Technology Constraint

Despite the advancements in [Random-Access Memory (RAM) Architecture](202403132022.md),
it is simply not economical to employ high speed memory controller as the memory
subsystems don't support high frequency information flow. Even if memory
subsystems can support such high frequency (as most CPU reaches 3k Hz), the
travel distance of the information will become so short, that latency is simply
inevitable, which will in turn effect the overall throughput.
