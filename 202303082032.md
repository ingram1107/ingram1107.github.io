# ARP poisoning

The [Intruder](202301021642.md) can use [ARP](202209301002.md) to learn the
[MAC](202212291225.md) addresses and [IP Addresses](202206281021.md) of
legitimate users on the network with *gratuitous ARP* (broadcast). This can be a
step before initiating [Man-In-The-Middle Attack (MITM)](202210132201.md)
attack. ARP poisoning can be avoided with dynamic ARP inspection which allow
rate-limited ARP requests and the block of bogus ARPs and gratuitous ARPs.
