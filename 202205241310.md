# Function-like Macro Hygiene

We need to use function-like macro with care to avoid writing a confusing macro
and/or resulting in an unexpected behaviour. Use function-like macro only if it
satisfys three conditions:

1. Only evaluate each argument once. (forbid unexpected behavoiur from
   incrementation or decrementation)
2. Parenthesise all arguments.
3. There is no hidden effects (side effects or unexpected control flow).
