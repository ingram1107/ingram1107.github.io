# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a methodology to organise [Note-Taking Tips](202204091053.md).
Instead of emphasise on categorising notes, it focuses on the *links* between
the notes, their [atomicity](202204091038.md)# and the progression of the notes.
It could be used to practise [Dialogic Learning](202205071138.md).

There are several types of zettels:
- [Fleeting Note](202203281520.md)#
- [Permanent Note](202203281521.md)#
- [Literature Note](202203281522.md)#

We could use the characteristics of Zettelkasten to track the progress of a
particular project in an index note where the links to the related topics are
concentrated there.

## Tagging

> Don't tag like an archivist, tag like a writer

Make the tags searchable and in a way that I want to search them. The tags shall
be relevant to the contents that the note is talking about or be related to
other topics. They should be a tool that is used to understand the context of the note, not as **a categorise tool** that try to establishing links between notes.

You could ask yourself this on deciding which tag should be used on the note:
In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note? What is the note primarily talking about?

## Folgezettel

In some situation, links alone does not provide much information about the
relation between notes. Sometimes, we need a tool to help progress our thought
process, to *direct us to the next step*.

Therefore, folgezettel should be viewed as a *sequence of the thought process*, at
least how generally will I progress on the topic. Again, as with tag, **do not get
the idea to use folgezettel as a categorise tool**.
