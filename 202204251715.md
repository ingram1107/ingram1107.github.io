# Common Lisp Static Type Checking

We could impose static type checking within #[202204251732](202204251732.md) using SBCL
implementation for global variables and functions. This means that type error
could be caught in compile time rather than relying on [202204251734](202204251734.md).

For example, we could declare a function that accept two number type values and
then return a number type value. This is shown as follows:

```lisp
(declaim (ftype (function (number number) number) adder))
; Similar to Haskell syntax
; adder :: Int -> Int -> Int
(defun adder (n1 n2)
  (+ n1 n2))
```

This told the Lisp compiler to verify whether the function `adder` matched the
declaration in the macro `declaim`. `ftype` means function type where the first
parameter indicate how should the function looks like and the second parameter
is the targeted function. `function` indicates that it is a normal function,
`(number number)` presents that both function parameters should be in number
type, and the last parameter `number` shows that the return type of it should be
in number type.

Similar declaration could be used in `defparameter` with `type`:

```lisp
(declaim (type number a))
(defparameter a 10)
```
