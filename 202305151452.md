# Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules

Shneiderman defined 8 #design rules for interface design, which are:
- Strive for [consistency](202305142214.md)
- Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
- Offer [informative feedback](202305142217.md)
- Design [dialogues](202305142216.md) to yield closure where sequences of
  actions should be organised into beginning, middle, and end
- Offer error prevention and simple [error handling](202305142217.md)
- Permit easy [reversal of actions](202305142217.md)
- Support internal locus of control, that is giving autonomy to user to tell the
  system what to do
- Reduce short-term [memory load](202304291456.md)
