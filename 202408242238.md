# Bottom-Up Information Assurance Approach

Bottom-up [Information Assurance](202408141942.md) apporach, in contrast to
[Top-Down Information Assurance Approach](202408231520.md), takes a perspective
from a functional department to implement a security program without the support
and direction from senior management. It is particularly effective when there is
a need of immediate security attention due to high risk or available budget. It
focuses fully on [Technical Control](202408221627.md) or [Operational Control](202408221625.md),
which is more effective by addressing daily operational requirements. Though, we
have to be careful about the thoroughness of the review of the organisation's
needs in such an approach.

Bottom-up approach has the benefit of creating a larger process, part, or system
by linking the elements, which enables faster integration. That being said, it
could be a challenge to gain support from senior managers primarily due to the
fears of losing respect and authority. The best solution to this is to inform
the senior management about the progress and decisions made.
