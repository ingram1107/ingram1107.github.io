# Issue Resolution

Issue resolution examines each issue that has been [identified](202305011153.md)
and [formulated](202305011157.md) and seek a means to resolve each of these. It
has implicit risk factors tied to each and every possible path that is open for
solution. In simple terms, we have to come out with multiple solutions and
choose the one with the least risk. An option field matrix is developed and
becomes part and parcel of [Audit Trail](202304302032.md).
