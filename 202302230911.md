# Zijn Conjugation

"Zijn" can be seen as roughly the "to be" equivalent in Dutch. Depends on the
[Dutch Personal Pronouns](202205102304.md), it can have different form shown in
below:

| Zijn              | Meaning                  |
| ---               | ---                      |
| Ik ben            | I am                     |
| Jij/Je/U bent     | You are                  |
| Hij/Zij/Het       | He/She/It is             |
| Wijn/Jullie/U/Zij | We/You (plural)/They are |

**Note**: In a [question](202302221947.md), however, "bent" for "jij" and "je"
will loss its "t" in the sentence. Meaning the proper question form is "Ben jij
Nederlands?" ("Are you Dutch?").
