# Divisibility

Suppose that $n$ and $d$ are integers and $d \not = 0$, then $n$ is *divisible
by* $d$ if, and only if, $n$ equals $d$ times some integer, in which we can
denote it as $d|n$. We can express it symbolically as:

$$
d | n \Leftrightarrow \exists \text{ an integer } k \text{ such that } n = dk
$$

There are two properties of divisibility of integers, i.e., (1) that if one
positive integer $a$, then $a$ is less than or equal to the second $b$, which is
$a \le b$, and (2) that the only divisors of 1 are 1 and -1. Another one is the
transitivity of divisibility, it states that for all integers $a$, $b$, and $c$,
if $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$.

In addition, any integer $n > 1$ is divisible by a [prime](202302281130.md). The
statement can be generalised as [Unique Factorisation of Integers Theorem](202303061618.md).

Based on the above statements, it follows (by negation) that $d$ doesn't divide
$n$ if, and only if, for all integers $k$, $n \not = dk$, or, in other words,
the quotient $\frac{n}{d}$ is not an integer.

$$
\forall \text{ integers } n \text{ and } d, d \not | n \Leftrightarrow
\frac{n}{d} \text{ is not an integer}
$$
