# Rust Associated Type

Associated type in Rust is defined as follows:

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
```

`Item` is defined as a placeholder for implementor to provides a concrete type.
While it resembles some similarities with [generic type](202410042122.md),
associated type only allows one implementation for a single class.
