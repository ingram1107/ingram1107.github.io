# Two-way Merge

Two-way Merge splits the file contents into parts where their size, $M$, could
be held by the main memory. Those parts will be sorted using one of the
[202203102004](202203102004.md) and we will pair those parts into runs which will be stored
into two separate drives or tapes. We will merge two parts by comparing them
sequentially until we have hit the end of the run. Follow the
[recursive rule](202202151731.md), we will repeat the steps stated before until we
have obtained a sorted result.

## Analysis

- It is optimal to have 4 drives or tapes in using Two-way Merge. Two of them
  used as input, the other two used as output. Their role is interchangeable
  depends on the run.
- It will require $\lceil \log(\frac{N}{M}) \rceil$ passes.
- This could be further optimised by [202203111148](202203111148.md)#
