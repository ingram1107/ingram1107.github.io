# Signal Handling

Use two layers of handlers in order to safely handling signals in C. The first
handler will process the initial signal that is intended to be handle manually.
The second handler will used to process the signal produced by the first
handler.

This could be achieve by using a nested function pointer:
```c
void (*signal(int si, void (*handler)(int)))(int)
```
