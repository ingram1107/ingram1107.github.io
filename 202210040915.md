# Authentication Exchange

Authentication Exchange is a #[Security Mechanism](202209261402.md) that confirm
an entity's identity by means of information exchange before gaining access to a
resource. It usually involves a unique piece of information that could
unambiguously recognise an entity such as [username/password pair](202210191444.md)#,
secret key, or biometric data.

A transparent Authentication Exchange could be happened if the user doesn't
aware that the [Authentication](202210022151.md)# is taking place. The
underlying mechanism is that the user is blocked by the network, without letting
they know that they are being blocked. After a successful authentication, the
user will be able to access the network since the port is open to the user.
