# Data Mining

Data mining is the process of turning raw data into meaningful information via
visualisation tools. The mined data must be analysed and presented to managers
and decision makers. We have to consider the number of variables, number of data
points in each variable, timeline-ness of the data, and items required
comparisons when determining the best visualisation tools to use.

**Note**: For graph, we may use line, column, bar, pie, or scatter graph.
