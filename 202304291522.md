# UI/UX Design Recommendation

To capture user attention, for example, we could use perceptual boundaries like
windows and spacing, colour including colour code, contrast, and its psychology,
reverse video, sound, flashing lights, ordering, text style, and animation. We
have to make the information stand out, favouring crisp (lively) and simple
design, without clutter the interface and/or abuse these features that add more
[Cognitive](202304291456.md) load to the user. However, voice and speech are
rarely used in a formal design as they can slow down the interactive process
between the user and the product.

In short, the information should be perceptible and recognisable easily. The use
of graphical representations should distinguish their meaning. Use border and
space wisely to group information. Audible and distinguishable sounds and speech
(clear spoken words) is recommended. Most importantly, the text must legible and
stand out from the background. We can further utilise the [External Cognition](202304291528.md).
