# Media Access Control Address (MAC)

MAC address is a manufacturer-allocated ID number attached to a device (a
computer or a network device such as [202207061800](202207061800.md)). It is
permanent and unique, unlike [202206151453](202206151453.md), meaning you can
identify a specific device across the network by referring to its MAC address.
An example to the MAC address: 89-F1-C3-28-3A-FF.
