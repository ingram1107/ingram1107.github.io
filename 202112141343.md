# Extendible Hashing

Extendible Hashing is a #[collision resolution strategy](202112131158.md) for
[202112122035](202112122035.md) that is similar to #[202112121935](202112121935.md).

Extendible Hashing could be used in:
- large databases

## Analysis

- Find in 2 disk accesses
- Insertions in few disk accesses
- Average leaf is 69% full
- Expected size of directory is $O(\frac{N^{1+\frac{1}{M}}}M)$

## Attention

- Hash key into reasonably long integers to avoid duplicate case
- Use leaves to contain pointers to the records to avoid small M
