# Server Templating

Server Templating tools are often used to set up an
[Immutable Infrastructure](202209271906.md)# using
[Virtual Machine (VM)](202204071131.md)# and [Container](202202211633.md)#
images. To modify the underlying infrastructure in demands of changing
requirements, it can simply update the existing images without affecting other
already running environment. #[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](202206061419.md)
sometimes involves Server Templating.

Several utilities can be used for this purpose:
- [Docker](202110201636.md)#
- HashiCorp Packer
- HashiCorp Vagrant
