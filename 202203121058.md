# Proletarian Feminism

Commodification of women is common among capitalist countries where women being
sold and/or used as an item rather than being treated as a genuine human being.
Women are much more than a reproducing machine.

Such privatisation on woman is not unique in capitalist society. We could see
the development of commodification of women across all the society, especially
class society, albeit appear in a different form such as patriarchy. It could be
further observed from Orcinus Orca's societal structure. Although they have
built up a society that is based on matriarchy, female Orca still suffer from
systemic violence such as rape. Thus, it is necessary to eliminate the class
society as a whole to truly liberate women from the oppressions.

In country such as Malaysia, women are treated in variety ways due to cultural
differences. Nevertheless, they are all treat women as an object rather than as
a human. They all treat women as a reproducing machine that should have
unquestionable loyalty to her partner.

There are some arguments that women are biological different from men thus
justifying the gender roles. Such logic confuses sex with gender, which define
female and male, but not the social construct man and woman. Intersex people
(have different chromosome pattern or have both sex genitals), for example, can
recognise their own gender without much hassle. Therefore, using biological
determinism as a point is not only a pseudo-science but also advocate for the
suppression of the women active participation of the society.
