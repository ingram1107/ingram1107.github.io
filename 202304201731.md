# Architecture

Architecture is a means for describing the elements and
[interactions](202303242108.md) of a complete [System](202303242148.md)
including its #hardware elements and its #software elements. When designing or
choosing an architecture, we should consider the following issues:
- corporate organisation and culture ([centralised](202304201752.md) or
  [decentralised](202304201754.md), advised to observe the business operations
  and discuss with the user at all levels)
- [Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)](202304201757.md)
- initial and total cost of ownership (hard costs: tangible purchases, fees, and
  contracts, and soft costs: management, support, training, and downtime)
- scalability (determine system's [lifespan](202303251356.md))
- web integration
- legacy system interface requirements (invovles data format analysis and
  compatibility, converting legacy file data may be too expensive, and instead
  opt for [middleware](202304201955.md), and eventually replace the legacy
  system with the new system)
- processing options ([online processing](202304202000.md) or
  [batch processing](202304202003.md))
- #security issues (especially remote data processing and [Web-based System](202304171942.md))
- corporate portals (entrance to multifunctional system, provide consistent
  interface while [integrate](202303242149.md) well with other systems)

  Formal evaluation on the architectural design concept should be done as soon
  as it is stable enough so that the problems could be addressed in early stage
  without paying much cost later. The most popular evaluation method is the
  [Scenario-based Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM)](202304211608.md) or its
  other specialisations.
