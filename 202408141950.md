# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is a subdomain of [Information Security](202408141946.md) with the
same objective within an **electronic information system**. It often focuses on
the vulnerabilities and threads of an information system at the tactical level
(system scanning, patching, secure configuration enforcement). Examples of
cybersecurity functions include [Intrusion Detection](202301031034.md), incident
response, and other functions run from a security operations centre (SOC).
