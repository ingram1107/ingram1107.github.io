# Hamming Code

Hamming Code is a $(n,k)$ #[Linear Block Code](202211041839.md) that can correct
only [single errors](202211162040.md)#. It must satisfy the following property:
- $n = 2^m - 1$
- $k = 2^m - m - 1$
- $n - k = m$
- $t = 1$

Where:
- $n$ is the code length
- $m$ is the number of parity bits, usually equals to or larger than 3
- $k$ is the number of information bits
- $t$ is the error correction capability

Since we need all $n$ rows in $H^T$ to be distinct, we need $2^{n-k} - 1 \ge n$
or the number of parity bits satisfies $(n-k) \ge \lg (n + 1)$.
