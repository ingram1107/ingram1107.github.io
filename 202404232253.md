# Round-Robin Scheduling

In round-robin scheduling, [processes](202210062301.md) are executed
sequentially to completion. Every process gets its time slice to be executed
within that time frame. If it hasn't completed its execution, a [context switch](202404141543.md)
will be triggered by an interrupt upon the expiration of the time slice. The
next-in-line process will restore its context and resumes its execution.

This scheduling policy guarantees fair allocation of CPU resources.
