# Memory Alignment

Memory Alignment depicts how the data shown be stored in the computer's memory.
Although most architectures align data in consecutive manner and even adjust
misalignment (like x86), programmers should not solely depend on this
assumption.

Because of the memory alignment, in [C](202302190647.md) and
[C++](202302190651.md), we could access stored data directly by using `union`
structure which contains `unsigned char` array.

Unaligned access can increase the slowdown which is especially noticeable in
sequential access. Most [Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs)](202205311022.md)
require all callers to have the stack aligned, but since stack frame size is not
necessary a multiple of the alignment, most compilers simply do the round up on
the frame size. Such method is not possible to be applied on variable length
arrays (VLAs) or object allocated through `alloaca()` as the total size of the
stack frame can be only known at runtime.
