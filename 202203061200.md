# Memory Alignment

Memory Alignment depicts how the data shown be stored in the computer's memory.
Although most architectures align data in consecutive manner and even adjust
misalignment (like x86), programmers should not solely depend on this
assumption.

Because of the memory alignment, in [C](202302190647.md) and
[C++](202302190651.md), we could access stored data directly by using `union`
structure which contains `unsigned char` array.
