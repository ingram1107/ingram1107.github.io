# Even or Odd

An integer $n$ is even if, and only if, $n$ equals twice [some](202204281254.md)
integer. An integer $n$ is odd if, and only if, $n$ equals twice
[some](202204281254.md) integer plus 1. That is:

$$
\begin{align}
n \text{ is even } &\Leftrightarrow \exists \text{ an integer } k \text{ such
that } n = 2k \text{.}\\
n \text{ is odd } &\Leftrightarrow \exists \text{ an integer } k \text{ such
that } n = 2k + 1 \text{.}
\end{align}
$$

As the integer is either even or odd, this property is called **parity
property**.
