# Physical Layer

Physical layer is the first in #[Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model](202206131632.md).
In #[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md), it is treated as Link
Layer together with [Data Link Layer](202206131651.md). It is responsible to
convert a [frame](202206131651.md) into *bits*, which is its
[Protocol Data Units (PDU)](202206131643.md)#, to be transmitted over the
networks. It has a mean to validate whether a data is corrupted.

Several protocols operate in this level:
- [Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)](202208311145.md)#
- [Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)](202209021758.md)#
