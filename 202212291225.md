# Message Authentication Code (MAC)

MAC is ~~a technique generates a small fixed-size block of data~~ an
authenticator that is a cryptographic function that generates a small fixed-size
block of data, using a secret key shared between sender and receiver
([Symmetric Cryptography](202209012153.md)#) and message to be authenticated as
parameters. It usually will be appended to the message. It provides
[Security Services](202209261050.md)# such as [Data Integrity](202210040913.md)#
and [data origin authentication](202210022151.md)# (whether the message is sent
by the claimed sender). However, it doesn't provide
[Non-Repudiation](202210022159.md)#.

The MAC, sometimes called cryptographic checksum, is computed based on the
message itself using many-to-one function (many messages related to the same
MAC), and it is not necessarily possible to revert to the original message by
only using MAC. To verify MAC, the receiver performs the same computation as the
sender did and compare the result with the received MAC to see if they are the
same. The following #math notation shows the basic concept of MAC:

$$
\text{MAC} = C_K(M)
$$

Where:
- $M$ is a variable-length message
- $K$ is a shared secret key
- $C$ is a cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt $M$

**Note**: The key size and the MAC size determine how secure is the MAC is.

For MAC to be secure, there are several requirements for it:
- It should be [computationally infeasible](202209281245.md)# to find another
  message with same MAC knowing a message and MAC
- MACs should be uniformly distributed so randomly chosen messages having less
  chance of having the same MAC
- MAC should depend equally on all bits of the message ([Avalanche Effect](202210052302.md))

**Note**: To crack the key, see [Brute Force Attack](202209281259.md).

The security concern is similar to what faced by [Hash Function](202112122038.md).

The following shows several implementations of MAC:
