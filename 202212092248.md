# Avoiding Timing Attack on RSA

#[Timing Attack](202210122125.md) invented by Paul Kocher exploits the
variations in the #[Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)](202210122110.md) operations. It
explores the possible operand size based on the time taken for each
exponentiation done in decryption algorithm.

Several ways of improvements could be done to the algorithm in order to avoid or
decrease the efficiency from timing:
1. Add constant exponentiation time so that every exponentiation take the same
   amount of time, however this degrades the performance.
2. Add random delays.
3. Use blind values in calculations (RSA Data Security) where the performance
   hit range between 2% to 10%.

An example of blind values calculations from RSA Data Security implementation:
1. Select a random $r$ from $Z_n^*$ which is kept secret.
2. Compute $C' = Cr^e \mod n$.
3. Compute $M' = (C')^d \mod n$.
4. Compute $M = M' r^{-1} \mod n = (Cr^e)^d r^{-1} \mod n = C^d r^{ed} r^{-1}
   \mod n = C^d \mod n$.

**Note**: $r^{ed} = r \mod n$ because $r^{ed} = r^{1 + k \phi(n)}$ from the
equation obtained above $de = 1 + k \phi(n)$. It is the same reason why $C^d =
M^{e \cdot d} \mod n = M \mod n$.

From the implementation above, the attacker could only see the time taken to
compute $M' = (C')^d \mod n$ where they can't obtain sufficient information to
crack the possible length of the operands $p$, $q$ and maybe $r$.
