# Shortest-Path Algorithm

Shortest-Path Algorithm is an algorithm that calculate the shortest path of one
vertex to all other vertices in a #[202204112118](202204112118.md). The path could be
unweighted or weighted. It is similar to [level-order traversal](202112102054.md).
Sometimes, it is wise to [202204151111](202204151111.md)# in order to store path information
for later usage.

There are several algorithms to handle different cases:
- [202204151055](202204151055.md)# for unweighted graph
- [202204151059](202204151059.md)# for weighted graph when there are no negative weight
- [202204151151](202204151151.md)# for weighted graph where there could be negative weight
- [202204200949](202204200949.md)# for known acyclic graph
