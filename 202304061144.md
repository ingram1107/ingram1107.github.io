# Infrared WLAN (IR WLAN)

Using infrared [WLAN](202302161710.md) has the benefits of unlimited spectrum
(possible of high data rates), unregulated, inexpensive and simple equipment,
wide coverage (reflection), and secure against [Interception](202209261916.md)
and interference (doesn't penetrate the walls). That being said, it requires
higher power transmitters but at the same time restricted by eye safety measure,
susceptible to signal loss due to flat surface reflection (enclosed
environment), depends on [Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)](202210290953.md), room
size and layout. Background noises can come from ambient lighting (sunlight and
artificial incandescent light), heaters, water vapour, particulate contamination
etc. At maximum range, there is a sharp cut-off due to the limits on receiver
sensitivity and background noises.

There are two types of infrared light that are suitable for communications:
- [Coherent/Directed Beam Infrared](202304101500.md)
- [Diffused Infrared](202304101503.md)
