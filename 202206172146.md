# Denying The Antecedent

Denying The Antecedent or Inverse Error is a #[Logical Fallacy](202206172053.md)
where one draw their conclusion from premises by replacing the premise $p
\rightarrow q$ by its inverse. From [Conditional Statement](202205062055.md)# we
know that the inverse of the conditional statement is not [logically equivalence](202205061231.md)#
to itself. The following shows its form:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \rightarrow q \\
&\sim p \\
\therefore \ &\sim q
\end{align}
$$

The rule also applies on [Universal Statement](202204281245.md).

$$
\begin{align}
&\forall x, \text{if } P(x) \text{ then } Q(x).\\
&~P(a), \text{for a particular } a.\\
\therefore \ &~Q(a)
\end{align}
$$
