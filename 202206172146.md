# Denying The Antecedent

Denying The Antecedent or Inverse Error is a #[202206172053](202206172053.md) where one draw their conclusion from premises by replacing the premise $p \rightarrow q$ by its inverse. From [202205062055](202205062055.md)# we know that the inverse of the conditional statement is not [logically equivalence](202205061231.md)# to itself. The following shows its form:

$$
\begin{align}
&p \rightarrow q \\
&\sim p \\
\therefore \ &\sim q
\end{align}
