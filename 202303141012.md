or **group names** owned by processes that maintains in a table by the NetBIOS
node. These names are flat and represented as small integer. The name bidding is
done by broadcasting the name registration. For unique names, it is registered
only if there are no match from unique names and group names used in the
network. For group names, it only needs not to match with the unique names used
in the network. IBM PC LAN Support Program will transmit name registration
