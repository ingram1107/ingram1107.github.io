# Modulator

Modulator is a machine or software that could transform channel code words to a
corresponding analogue symbol. For example, the symbol could be into waveform
when there is a need to travel in [Fibre-Optic Cable](202209021233.md).

At the receiver side, Modulator will act as a *Demodulator*, where it transforms
the analogue symbol into estimated channel code words and pass it to
#[Channel Encoder](202209291041.md).
