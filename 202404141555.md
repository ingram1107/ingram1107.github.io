# Rate Monotonic System

Rate Monotonic System is a special class of [fixed-rate](202404141448.md)
[Pre-emptive Priority System](202404141550.md) interrupt driven system. The
priority label is assigned based on the execution frequency (the higher the
frequency, the higher the priority). It is the optimal fixed-priority scheduling
method. Rate monotonic system is quite common in embedded applications,
especially in avionics systems.
