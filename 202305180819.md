# Short Message Service (SMS)

SMS is a service allowing sending of text messages up to 160 characters for
Latin alphabet or 70 characters for others between cell phones. The message
format contains the message length, time stamp, destination phone number, the
format etc.

There will be a control channel that constantly sending and receiving
information even when the phone is inactive. This channel can be used by the
cell phone system by packet exchanging to track the phone status and its
[cell](202303292214.md) location as the phone is [moving around](202303292141.md)
while constantly changing its ownership by which cell. It also provides a
pathway for SMS messages so that when the message sent remotely from a location
and passed through SMSC and the tower, the tower can send the message to the
phone.
