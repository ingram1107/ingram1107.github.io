# Public-Key Certificate

Public-Key Certificate is issued or signed by a trusted public-key or
Certificate Authority (CA), such as VeriSign, which binds identity to public
key. It allows #[public key exchange](202203221212.md) without real-time access
to [Public-Key Authority](202210122229.md). It usually contains the user's name
and the corresponding public key used. The certificate can be verified by anyone
who knows the public-key authority's public key. However, only the CA has the
authority to modify the certificate. It can be placed in public directory as it
cannot be forged. The most common format of Public-Key Certificate is
[X.509](202210221040.md).
