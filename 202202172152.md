# Socket Programming

Socket Programming aims to connect two computers or processes by specifying with
socket, which is a pair of [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)# and
[port number](202206151841.md)#, that is an end point of communication. By
establishing a socket, both of them could communicate in duplex mode or both
directions, in and out, using [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md)#.
However, in socket programming, we usually define two entity: server and client.
Server as the sender who send the messages, client as the receiver who receive
and/or process the messages.

## Library Used

There are four libraries to use in Linux: `sys/types.h` and `sys/socket.h` for
socket definitions and functions, `netinet/in.h` for address information and
`unistd.h` for closing sockets.

There would be the case that we will need to import the library `arpa/inet.h` in
order to call `inet_aton`. It is used to convert string to IP address.

## Server

To establish a [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#
connection, a server often has such procedure: First, it needs to establish a
**socket**. Next, it needs to **bind** the corresponding socket to a dedicated
IP and port. Then, it will **listen** to the socket and **wait for accepting**
incoming connection. If there is a client established a connection, it can then
**send** any data, if they are available, to the client.

The following is its implementation in C:
```c
int serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // Use TCP for connection

struct sockaddr_in serverAddress = {
  .sin_family = AF_INET,          // IPv4
  .sin_port = htons(9002),        // convert to network bytes which is big-endian
  // .sin_port = 0,               // for port automatic assignent from the operating system
  .sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY,  // To 0.0.0.0 or any address
  // .sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("198.164.2.10") // define an IP address instead of INADDR_ANY
};

int bindStatus = bind(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr *) &serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress));
if (bindStatus == -1) {
  perror("Fail to bind the socket");
}

listen(serverSocket, 5); // 5 connection request that can be queue by the system for the socket

int clientSocket = accept(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr_in *) &clientAddress, sizeof(clientAddress));

send(clientSocket, &serverData, sizeof(serverData), 0);

close(clientSocket);
close(serverSocket);
```

The server could send a response to the client by `write()` instead of `send()`.
The difference is that `send()` will return error when the message sent is too
big for the protocol to handle. Otherwise, in most cases, they are almost
identical.

`close()` call could be replaced by `shutdown(socketfd, 2)` which behaves
identically. However, `shutdown()` provides more flexibility to the programmer
as it could be used to close send and/or receive channel for the socket. Passing
0 indicates the receive channel is close for the socket, 1 for disallowing send
channel to be used on the socket.

**Note**: If there is a need to receive client's data, declare a `struct
sockaddr` and pass it to the second parameter of `accept`. Remember to pass in
the size for `struct sockaddr`.

**Note**: Always ensure that the port number and IP address and is stored in
[Big-Endian](202202220906.md)#. This can be done by calling `htons` on the port
number and `htonl` on the IP address if both of them are of integer values (type
of `short` or `long`). The translation could be reversed with the function
`ntohs` and `ntohl`.

**Note**: If the [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) is a string with dotted format,
we can translate it to 32 bit network address with the function `inet_addr`.
Vice versa, we can get an IPv4 address string with dotted format from a network
address with the function `inet_ntoa`.

## Client

In [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)# connection, client
requires fewer steps than server. First, like server, it needs to establish a
**socket**. Thereafter, client will **connect** itself to the socket. And then,
it will wait for the response from the server and **receive** any data
transmitted from there.

The following is its implementation in C:
```c
// use TCP for connection
// 0 in this case can be IPPROTO_TCP
// for UDP (see UDP section), it's IPPROTO_UDP
int networkSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

struct sockaddr_in serverAddress = {
  .sin_family = AF_INET,          // IPv4
  .sin_port = htons(9002),        // convert to network bytes which is big-endian
  // .sin_port = 0,               // for port automatic assignent from the operating system
  .sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY,  // To 0.0.0.0 or any address
  // .sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("198.164.2.10") // define an IP address instead of INADDR_ANY
};

inet_pton(AF_INET, argv[1], &serverAddress);  // or assigns IP address
                                              // according to user input

int connectionStatus = connect(networkSocket, (struct sockaddr *) &serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress));
if (connectionStatus == -1) {
  perror("Fail to establish socket connection");
}

recv(networkSocket, &serverResponse, sizeof(serverResponse), 0);

close(networkSocket);
return 0;
```

The client could read a message from the server by `read()` instead of `recv()`.
The difference is that `recv()` will return error when the message sent is too
big for the protocol to handle. Otherwise, in most cases, they are almost
identical.

**Note**: The opposite function for `inet_pton` is `inet_ntop` which converts
network address to string.

## UDP Connection

Socket programming in [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)# is much
fewer steps to set up compare to TCP. Both server and client just need to
establish **socket** (pass in `SOCK_DGRAM` instead of `SOCK_STREAM` for UDP
connection) and **bind** it to an address for themselves. Then, they could call
either `sendto()` or `recvfrom()` to send or receive any data transmitted by
them. Note that `sendto()` requires to know the **destination address** (it is
optional on `recvfrom(), thus `NULL` value for address is acceptable).
Otherwise, its structure is almost identical to the above TCP implementation.

**Note**: `connect()` can be called from a client with the intention to obtain
and store the server address. Additionally, error notification can be triggered
if there is invalid address encounter, with the assumption that the underlying
connectionless protocol supports it.

**Note**: For `send()`, `recv()`, `sendto()`, and `recvfrom()`, there is an
option to pass a flag as a parameter to the function. They are 0 as nothing,
`MSG_OOB` (sends out-of-band data, that can arrived faster than normal data as
it is sent through a separate communication channel, on sockets), `MSG_PEEK`
(peek incoming message, for `recv()` and `recvfrom()`) and `MSG_DONTROUTE`
(ignore routing conditions, for `send()` and `sendto()`, seems like deprecated).

## Miscellaneous

`AF_INET` also supports `SOCK_RAW` for socket establishment (and with
combination of `IPPROTO_ICMP` for [ICMP](202209270927.md) in protocol field).

Alternatives to `send()`, `recv()`, `sendto()`, and `recvfrom()` for scatter
reading and gather writing on non-contiguous buffers are `readv()`, `writev()`,
`sendmsg()`, and `recvmsg()` respectively. Four of them need to import
`<sys/types.h>`, former two need `<sys/uio.h>`, and the latter two need
`<sys/socket.h>`. Both `readv()` and `writev()` guarantee atomic operation. They
are useful in cases where there is a need to append header to the message (such
as in [Encapsulation](202210012046.md)) without the need of two separate writes
operation (one on the header, one on the payload/data). The resulting message
will be treated as a single datagram. Do note that it is not portable beyond
POSIX system. The following codes show each use case, note that the number of
element of the `iovec` array must be passed to the system calls:

```c
char *str0 = "Ingram ";
char *str1 = "Ham\n";
struct iovec iov[2];
iov[0] = {
  .iov_base = str0,         // starting address of the buffer
  .iov_len = strlen(str0);  // byte size of the buffer
};
iov[1] = {
  .iov_base = str1,
  .iov_len = strlen(str1);
};

// passing the socket file descriptor, array of iovec, and its number of elements
if ((ssize_t n  = writev(sockfd, iov, 2)) != strlen(str0) + strlen(str1)) {
  // error handling...
}

if (readv(sockfd, iov, 2) < 0) {
  // error handling...
}

struct msghdr msg = {
  .msg_name = serverAddress,        // destination address, optional
  .msg_len = sizeof(serverAddress), // size of the address
  .msg_iov = iov,                   // scatter/gather array
  .msg_iovlen = 2,                  // number of elements in array
  .msg_control = (void *) &fd,      // control/ancillary information
  .msg_controllen = sizeof(fd),     // size of the control/ancillary information
};

if (sendmsg(sockfd, msg, 0) < 0) {
  // error handling...
}

if (recvmsg(sockfd, msg, 0) < 0) {
  // error handling...
}
```

**Note**: Referencing to the above codes, we can see that we can pass the
[File Descriptor](202210172248.md) between two different processes with
`sendmsg()` and `recvmsg()` (using the [Unix Domain Socket](202303232001.md)).
This is the only valid way to pass around the file descriptor so that the
processes can share the access rights to the same file, which particularly
useful in parent-child #parallelism execution and network (limited to Unix)
connections where server responds to client's request with open file descriptor
or error.

Additionally, we could alter the socket's default option for more convenient set
up using the system call `setsockopt()`. The parameters that should be passed
are the socket [File Descriptor](202210172248.md), the level (who in the system
to interpret this option, most common used levels are `IPPROTO_IP`,
`IPPROTO_TCP`, and `SOL_SOCKET`), the option name, the option's value, and the
value's length. The usage is shown below:

```c
// Allow local address reuse for the sockfd in the level of general socket code
if (setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (const char *) &yes, sizeof(yes)) == -1) {
  perror("setsockopt error");
  exit(1);
}
```

**Note**: `getsockopt()` has the same parameter numbers and types other than the
value's length. Instead, the value's length parameter is one of the output
parameters, so it should be passed as a reference. Like the name suggested, it
gets value (boolean or others) of the corresponding socket option.

**Note**: See `man 7 ip`, `man 7 tcp`, and `man 7 socket` section **Socket
options** for available options for `setsockopt()` and `getsockopt()` for the
levels `IPPROTO_IP`, `IPPROTO_TCP`, and `SOL_SOCKET` respectively.

Both [Unix System Call](202210062303.md) `fcntl()` and `ioctl()` could be used
to set additional properties to the socket via commands. Concerning commands for
socket from `fcntl()` are `F_SETDOWN` and `F_GETOWN`, and `F_SETFL` and
`F_GETFL`. The former pair set or get either process ID (positive integer value)
or process group ID (negative integer value other than -1) to or currently
receiving `SIGIO` and `SIGURG` signals. The latter pair set or get the file's
(referenced by the file descriptor) flag bit, where we only concerns about the
flag `O_NONBLOCK` and `O_ASYNC`. `O_NONBLOCK` is especially useful for
connection-oriented protocols like [TCP](202206151232.md) allowing non-blocking
I/O and return immediately from the `connect()` and the `errno` is set to
`EINPROGRESS`. `O_ASYNC` sends the `SIGIO` to the process group that the socket
belongs to, allowing [asynchronous I/O](202304281232.md). Likewise, `SIOCSPGRP`
and `SIOCGPGRP` request options from `ioctl()` is the equivalence to `F_SETDOWN`
and `F_GETOWN`. We can also allow asynchronous I/O with the request option
`FIOASYNC` like how we set `O_ASYNC` in `F_SETFL`.

We can get the socket's name (server or client) with the functions
`getsocketname()` and `getpeername()` by passing socket [File Descriptor](202210172248.md),
socket address, and its length. The former returns the local associated address
(server) and the latter returns the foreign associated address (client).
