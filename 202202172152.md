# Socket Programming

Socket Programming aims to connect two computers or processes by specifying with
socket, which is a pair of [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md)# and
[port number](202206151841.md)#, that is an end point of communication. By
establishing a socket, both of them could communicate in duplex mode or both
directions, in and out, using [Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)](202206151238.md)#.
However, in socket programming, we usually define two entity: server and client.
Server as the sender who send the messages, client as the receiver who receive
and/or process the messages.

## Library Used

There are four libraries to use in Linux: `sys/types.h` and `sys/socket.h` for
socket definitions and functions, `netinet/in.h` for address information and
`unistd.h` for closing sockets.

There would be the case that we will need to import the library `arpa/inet.h` in
order to call `inet_aton`. It is used to convert string to IP address.

## Server

To establish a [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)#
connection, a server often has such procedure: First, it needs to establish a
**socket**. Next, it needs to **bind** the corresponding socket to a dedicated
IP and port. Then, it will **listen** to the socket and **wait for accepting**
incoming connection. If there is a client established a connection, it can then
**send** any data, if they are available, to the client.

The following is its implementation in C:
```c
int serverSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0); // Use TCP for connection

struct sockaddr_in serverAddress = {
  .sin_family = AF_INET,          // IPv4
  .sin_port = htons(9002),        // convert to network bytes which is big-endian
  .sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY,  // To 0.0.0.0
  // .sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("198.164.2.10") // define an IP address instead of INADDR_ANY
};

int bindStatus = bind(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr *) &serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress));
if (bindStatus == -1) {
  perror("Fail to bind the socket");
}

listen(serverSocket, 5); // 5 connection request that can be queue by the system for the socket

int clientSocket = accept(serverSocket, (struct sockaddr_in *) &clientAddress, sizeof(clientAddress));

send(clientSocket, &serverData, sizeof(serverData), 0);

close(clientSocket);
close(serverSocket);
```

Instead of `send()` data to the socket, one could receive data from the client
invoking `read()` function on the client socket. It is especially useful in
determining the validity of the client request such as in
#[Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](202202211439.md) socket programming. Other
than that, the server could send a response to the client by `write()` instead
of `read()`. The difference is that `send()` will return error when the message
sent is too big for the protocol to handle. Otherwise, in most cases, they are
almost identical.

`close()` call could be replaced by `shutdown(socketfd, 2)` which behaves
identically. However, `shutdown()` provides more flexibility to the programmer
as it could be used to close send and/or receive channel for the socket. Passing
0 indicates the receive channel is close for the socket, 1 for disallowing send
channel to be used on the socket.

**Note**: If there is a need to receive client's data, declare a `struct
sockaddr` and pass it to the second parameter of `accept`. Remember to pass in
the size for `struct sockaddr`.

**Note**: Always ensure that the port number and IP address and is stored in
[Big-Endian](202202220906.md)#. This can be done by calling `htons` on the port
number and `htonl` on the IP address if both of them are of integer values (type
of `short` or `long`). The translation could be reversed with the function
`ntohs` and `ntohl`.

**Note**: If the [IPv4 Address](202206151453.md) is a string with dotted format,
we can translate it to 32 bit network address with the function `inet_addr`.
Vice versa, we can get an IPv4 address string with dotted format from a network
address with the function `inet_ntoa`.

## Client

In [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](202206151232.md)# connection, client
requires fewer steps than server. First, like server, it needs to establish a
**socket**. Thereafter, client will **connect** itself to the socket. And then,
it will wait for the response from the server and **receive** any data
transmitted from there.

The following is its implementation in C:
```c
// use TCP for connection
// 0 in this case can be IPPROTO_TCP
// for UDP (see UDP section), it's IPPROTO_UDP
int networkSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

struct sockaddr_in serverAddress = {
  .sin_family = AF_INET,          // IPv4
  .sin_port = htons(9002),        // convert to network bytes which is big-endian
  .sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY,  // To 0.0.0.0
  // .sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("198.164.2.10") // define an IP address instead of INADDR_ANY
};

inet_pton(AF_INET, argv[1], &serverAddress);  // or assigns IP address
                                              // according to user input

int connectionStatus = connect(networkSocket, (struct sockaddr *) &serverAddress, sizeof(serverAddress));
if (connectionStatus == -1) {
  perror("Fail to establish socket connection");
}

recv(networkSocket, &serverResponse, sizeof(serverResponse), 0);

close(networkSocket);
return 0;
```

**Note**: The opposite function for `inet_pton` is `inet_ntop` which converts
network address to string.

## UDP Connection

Socket programming in [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](202206151759.md)# is much
fewer steps to set up compare to TCP. Both server and client just need to
establish **socket** (pass in `SOCK_DGRAM` instead of `SOCK_STREAM` for UDP
connection) and **bind** it to an address for themselves. Then, they could call
either `sendto()` or `recvfrom()` to send or receive any data transmitted by
them. Note that both `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` requires to know the
**destination address**. Otherwise, its structure is almost identical to the
above TCP implementation.

**Note**: `connect()` can be called from a client with the intention to obtain
and store the server address. Additionally, error notification can be triggered
if there is invalid address encounter, with the assumption that the underlying
connectionless protocol supports it.

**Note**: For `send()`, `recv()`, `sendto()`, and `recvfrom()`, there is an
option to pass a flag as a parameter to the function. They are 0 as nothing,
`MSG_OOB` (sends out-of-band data, that can arrived faster than normal data as
it is sent through a separate communication channel, on sockets), `MSG_PEEK`
(peek incoming message, for `recv()` and `recvfrom()`) and `MSG_DONTROUTE`
(ignore routing conditions, for `send()` and `sendto()`, seems like deprecated).

## Miscellaneous

`AF_INET` also supports `SOCK_RAW` for socket establishment (and with
combination of `IPPROTO_ICMP` for [ICMP](202209270927.md) in protocol field).

Additionally, we could alter the socket's default option for more convenient set
up using the system call `setsockopt()`. The parameters that should be passed
are the socket [File Descriptor](202210172248.md), the level (who in the system
to interpret this option), the option name, the option's value, and the value's
length. The usage is shown below:

```c
// Allow local address reuse for the sockfd in the level of general socket code
if (setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (const char *) &yes, sizeof(yes)) == -1) {
  perror("setsockopt error");
  exit(1);
}
```

We can get the socket's name (server or client) with the functions
`getsocketname()` and `getpeername()` by passing socket [File Descriptor](202210172248.md),
socket address, and its length. The former returns the local associated address
(server) and the latter returns the foreign associated address (client).
