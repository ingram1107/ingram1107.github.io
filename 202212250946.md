# I/O Multiplexing

There will be the case where asynchronous I/O is desired in order to serve
different I/O events or channels at the same time. For example, a
[Program](202210062258.md)# might have to serve two read requests from different
[Processes](202210062301.md). However, since serving one read request will
always block another, it is unwise to listen just one of the socket and wait for
it since the program can't know which one will arrive first. It is the same
concern for asynchronous [Socket Programming](202202172152.md) where the server
might need to serve two sockets at the same time while being ignorant about the
order of their arrival. I/O Multiplexing using three [Unix System Call](202210062303.md)# :
`select()`, `pselect()`, and `poll()`. Other solutions like polling or
non-blocking I/O or enabling asynchronous I/O exist, but they are either too slow
or too expensive in practice.

## Select

`select()` system call, receiving either **three** file descriptor sets
(described below) including read, write and exceptional file descriptor sets,
allows the user process to instruct the [Kernel](202210062254.md) to wait for
either reading, writing, or exceptional I/O events to happen and to wake up the
process only when one of these events occur. The first argument for `select()`
should be the highest-numbered file descriptor (`numfds`) to be tested in any of
passed three sets plus 1. With this system call, we can monitor several sockets
(up until the limit `numfds`) via their [File Descriptor](202210172248.md)# at
the same time to see which one is ready for reading, which one is ready for
writing etc. in a non-blocking manner. Meaning, the process will only be
notified when the data is readily available for reading from either socket. An
example usage of `select()` is shown below:

```c
fd_set read_fds;
struct timeval tv;
tv.tv_sec = 2;        // in second
tv.tv_usec = 500000;  // in microsecond

// Process can read from standard input and return after 2.5 seconds
select(STDIN + 1, &read_fds, (fd_set *) 0, (fd_set *) 0, &tv);
```

As you can see, we initialised a `timeval` struct to indicate the timeout for
the system call. If the value for `tv_sec` and `tv_usec` is 0, it indicates for
a *polling*, that is to return `select()` immediately after checking the
descriptors instead of waiting for the data to arrive. If there are values for
two of these fields, this will be the timeout (the sum of `tv_sec` and
`tv_usec`) for the `select()` to wait for available data. If `timeval` is a
NULL, then it is essentially the same with synchronous I/O where the program
will be blocked until there is available data to be read in the file descriptor.

We can further manipulate the file descriptor set (variable type of `fd_set`)
with the function `FD_ZERO()`, `FD_SET()`, `FD_CLR()`, and `FD_ISSET()`. The
usage is shown below:

```c
fd_set set;
FD_ZERO(&set);      // initialise set as an empty set
FD_SET(1, &set);    // include fd 1, which is STDOUT, to the set
FD_CLR(3, &set);    // remove fd 3 from the set
FD_ISSET(10, &set); // return value indicates whether fd 10 is in the set
```

**Note**: In [Socket Programming](202202172152.md), we need to check whether the
file descriptor that we are checking is the server socket file descriptor.
Different behaviours are desired for server socket and client sockets as the
former is for connection purpose and the latter is data-oriented.

**Note**: Exceptional conditions are referring to two cases: the arrival of the
[out-of-bound data](202306252120.md) and the presence of control status
information to be read from the master side of the [pseudo-terminal](202307011324.md)
that has been put into packet mode. If either condition is met,
[`SIGURG`](202211022139.md) will be generated.

## Pselect

`pselect()` is quite similar to `select()` functionality wise, with one
additional argument that point to a [signal mask](202211022139.md)# and a change
to the timeout structure. It accepts `timespec` struct instead of `timeval`,
where the second field changes to `tv_nsec` in nanosecond unit. The signal mask
will determine which signal should be blocked for the file descriptor set.

## Poll

`poll()` is a System V system call that functionality wise identical to of
`select()`. However, instead of organising the file descriptors by their type of
operations, it organises them into an array where each of them could have
different events to be handled individually and whether they have occurred. The
following example shows its usage:

```c
struct pollfd {
  int fd;         // file descriptor
  short events;   // requested events
  short revents;  // returned events
};

struct pollfd client[15];
client[0].fd = listenfd;
client[0].events = POLLRDNORM;

// waits indefinitely for the file decriptors in client to become ready to
// perform I/O, 16 defined the sizes of the pollfd to be checked.
// Upon successfull polling, it will return number of file descriptors that are
// ready
nready = poll(client, 16, INFTIM);

if (client[0].revents & POLLRDNORM) { // check if the event have occurred
  ...
}
```

The timeout value could be -1 (or `INFTIM`), 0 or more than 0. 0 indicates
non-blocking behaviour, where the system call will return immediately if there
is no data available. If the timeout value is more than 0, then it will be
treated as the waiting time for the event to occurred measured in
*milliseconds*.

The possible events could be handled in this system call are shown in the
following table:

| Events       | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ---          | ---                                                                                      |
| `POLLIN`     | read other than high priority data without blocking                                      |
| `POLLRDNORM` | read normal data without blocking                                                        |
| `POLLRDBAND` | read priority data without blocking                                                      |
| `POLLPRI`    | read high-priority data (including [Out-of-Bound Data](202306252120.md) without blocking |
| `POLLOUT`    | write normal data without blocking                                                       |
| `POLLWRNORM` | same as `POLLOUT`                                                                        |
| `POLLERR`    | error occurred on the descriptor                                                         |
| `POLLHUP`    | device has been disconnected                                                             |
| `POLLNVAL`   | file descriptor invalid                                                                  |

The limitation of using `poll()` comparing to the `select()` is that it can only
be used to determined the I/O status of the descriptor that is a [stream-based device](202306300811.md).
