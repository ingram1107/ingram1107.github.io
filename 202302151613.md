# Programming Language Evaluation Criteria

We can evaluate a programming language with on the following criteria based on
its characteritics:
- **readability**
- **writability**
- **reliability**
- **cost**
- **portability**
- **generality** (applicability to wide range of applications)
- **well-defineness** (official defining document's completeness and precision)

**Note**: All criteria might be conflicted with each other, there is a need for
trade-offs depending on the needs of the language designer.

We can evaluate its readability and writability by looking at the *overall
simplicity* of the language constructs and *orthogonality*. If the set of the
language constructs is rather small, we can say that the programming language is
simple. Things like feature multiplicity (many ways to do the same thing) and
operator overloading have negative effect on language simplicity. Orthogonality
means that a small set of primitives can combine to form complex data structures
due to the relative independent of the construct of its appearance. If the
programming language has low orthogonality, it could lead to exception to the
rules that complicates the programming language. Furthermore, language features
like *data types* and *syntax design* (keywords, and form and meaning) play
important role in programming language's readability.

The *support of abstraction*, which can be categorised into process abstraction
(allowing subroutine definition) and data abstraction, affects the writability
of a programming language on whether the language provides the facility for the
programmer to express complex data structure with ease. The *expressivity* of a
language also has the same effect on the programming language.

Programming language's characteristics such as *type checking*, *#exception
handling*, and *[Aliasing](202205171500.md)* affects its reliability.
Readability during the maintenance phase and writability (allowing
counterintuitive approach) can affect the reliability of a language indirectly.

Cost of training programmer, writing program, compiling source code,
executing program, language implementation system, poor reliability and
maintaining should be considered when selecting a language for a problem domain.
The cost of training and writing is influenced by the programming environment.

The portability of a programming language is greatly depends on the degree of
the standardisation of the language.
